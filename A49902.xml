            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHEN I firſt began to read this Book, I took up a ſtrong Conceit that it was written by the Order of the <hi>French Court,</hi> of purpoſe to make the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> jealous of the Emperor, and of the Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> by ſhewing them how their Brethren had been treated in <hi>Hungary,</hi> both as to their Religion and their Civil Liberties, which I believe were the true foundation of this long and dangerous War, which brought the Imperial Houſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Hair's breadth of Ruin: for had the <hi>Prime-Viſier,</hi> in <hi>1683,</hi> taken <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King been called in (as in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance he muſt) to ſave the reſt of the
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:110070:5"/>
               <hi>Germans</hi> from the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Yoke, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence would have been the utter ruine of this Branch of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family, of the Liberties of <hi>Germany,</hi> and conſequently, of the Liberty of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion. But by conſidering the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and Plainneſs of theſe Memoires, one may conclude there can be no other Deſign in the Author, than to tranſmit to Poſterity pure Matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>If any thing in this World were capable of making a zealous <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Prince reflect on the Dangers the Jeſuits expoſe them to, for their own Intereſt, this were enough to make all the crowned Heads, that ſhall live hereafter, ſuſpect and avoid the precipitate, fooliſh, unjuſt Counſels of this ſort of Men. It is true, what ſo much threatned the ruine of the Emperor, by a wonderful Turn of the Divine Providence, in the event, became an Occaſion of wreſting <hi>Hungary</hi> intirely out of the Hands of the <hi>Turks;</hi> and the <hi>Imperial</hi> Forces purſuing their Advantages, in the end, brought the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Houſe into the ſame Danger the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> had ſo happily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped: but then this is owing intirely to the Goodneſs of God; and the Counſels that brought the Emperor into that Danger, are as much to be deteſted, as if they had ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>It is much to be obſerved, that the ſame Methods that were uſed in <hi>Hungary,</hi> to ruine the Proteſtant Religion, and the Civil Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:110070:5"/>of that Nation, were alſo imployed after that in <hi>France</hi> for the ſame End; and began in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the laſt Reign; and carried as far as they had Time and Means to carry them, and by the ſame Men. So that it ſeems to be a formed Deſign, intended to be acted in one Place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, throughout <hi>Europe.</hi> It is hard, otherwiſe, to conceive how the ſame Maxims, and the ſame Politicks, ſhould be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in ſuch diſtant Places.</p>
            <p>The firſt natural Inference that will ariſe from hence, is, That we can never enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Goodneſs of God in Delivering us ſo timely and ſo wonderfully out of a Danger which would have certainly prepared <hi>England</hi> for Ruine, if it had been effected.</p>
            <p>But the beſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of this is to be made by the <hi>Non-ſwearers:</hi> Let them conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly what Treatment the <hi>Hungarians</hi> have all met with; as well thoſe that ſtuck to the Emperor, as thoſe that joined with the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents: Let them conſider how little the Loyalty of the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> was conſidered by the Preſent French King, who had been depoſed in his Minority but for them: How little the Loyalty of thoſe that had twice ſaved the late King, was regarded either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> when they found theſe Men would not abandon the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,</hi> and the Civil Liberties of <hi>England</hi> to them.</p>
            <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:110070:6"/>
            <p>I am morally certain, there is no Man in <hi>England,</hi> of any Prudence, doth expect any better Treatment from the late King, if he ſhould return, than they met with before; but rather much worſe: and therefore, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to ſee ſo many reputed wiſe Men ſtand out againſt the Preſent Government, and ſeem to deſire nothing more than to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the Nation into ſuch a Condition as muſt inevitably end in the Deſtruction of the late King, and the whole Royal Family, or the Ruine of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Civil Liberties of <hi>England.</hi> They every Day peſter us with Libels againſt Their Majeſties Perſons and Government, and incurable Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their own; but when they come to ſhew how the Nation ſhould be ſecured, in caſe they had what they deſire, never did Men, in their right Wits, talk more childliſhly and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently.</p>
            <p>Leaving them as incurable, I wiſh the reſt of the Nation would read this little Book, and compare exactly in their Minds, what was done in <hi>Hungary,</hi> according to the Report of this Author, with what was done, or apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended to be done in <hi>England;</hi> and then I believe the Conſequence of it will be a fixed Reſolution to ſpend the laſt Drop of their Bloods, and the laſt Penny of their Money, in the Defence of the Preſent Government.</p>

               <p>IF thoſe that have any ſhare in the Management of the States whereof <hi>Europe</hi> is compoſed, were mindful to leave to Poſterity, Memoirs of what comes within their Knowledge, it would not at all be neceſſary to make ſuch haſte in publiſhing the Actions of Living Perſons. Thoſe who ſhould come after us might inform themſelves by by theſe Memoirs, after the Death of the Authors, and of thoſe whoſe Hiſtory
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110070:7"/>would be comprehended therein. But Miniſters of State minding nothing leſs, than to write what has paſs'd under their Adminiſtration. Private Men ought not to be blamed, who carefully obſerving what falls out in <hi>Europe,</hi> and forgetting nothing as much as in them lies to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Truth from Falſhood, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh what paſſed in the view of all the World, without expecting the Death of thoſe whoſe Hiſtory they compoſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they preſerve the Memory of a great many Matters of Fact, which would otherwiſe be forgot, they thereby put themſelves in a ſtate of reaping Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the Advice of thoſe who have been concern'd in the things they ſpeak of, and to deliver nothing for certain but what is unqueſtionable. A very great number of Events and Circumſtances that are uſeful to be known, are like Summer Fruits, which we muſt quickly gather, or reſolve to eat them corrupted; if we don't publiſh ſome things in the Times wherein they happen, Poſterity learns them only by a confuſed Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which mixes Falſhood with Truth, and often ſuppreſſes the moſt Eſſential parts.</p>
               <p>This has made me take up a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of giving the Publick what I could remark on the Life of <hi>Emeric Count of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110070:7"/>Tekeli,</hi> on whoſe perſon the Eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> have been fixt for ſeveral Years; without expecting his death to publiſh what I could know of him. I am far from flattering my ſelf with the thoughts of my having collected what may make a compleat Hiſtory, but at leaſt I can ſay that having no particular Intereſt, either to praiſe or diſpraiſe him, I omit nothing with a deſign to conceal the Truth, as I add nothing herein to the advantage or diſadvantage of any perſon. Beſides, we muſt not believe that all the Life of Men that make a great figure in the World, ſhould be always full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Intrigues. The greateſt Men, as well as others, employ the half of their Life to ſatisfie the Neceſſities of Nature, and it is very much, that the other half is ſpent in a manner worthy of being known to Poſterity.</p>

On the other ſide, the Nobility of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſaw with ſorrow an Elective Kingdom, to which their Merit might have formerly exalted them, become, in a ſort, Hereditary to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whoſe Party was always the ſtrongeſt in the Elections. They fear'd that in time it would become ſo powerful, that the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> ſtript of all their Priviledges, would have no more Liberty left them, than the Subjects of Hereditary Princes have at this day in the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> A conſiderable part of the Hungarians, that followed <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> and who had a free exerciſe of their Religion,<note place="margin">And Religion.</note> feared further the loſs of the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> which they enjoyed with great comfort. Theſe Fears were ſenſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſt, becauſe the Kings of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who were not in the leaſt ignorant of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that People, endeavoured to take meaſures to prevent this Diſtruſt from producing any Diſturbance hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Nobility and People on their part, lookt upon theſe Precautions, as Chains prepared to fetter them with, when they leaſt thought of it. They could not without a great deal of grief ſee them introduce as many Germans into Publick Places as was poſſible, which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly beſtowed only upon the Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110070:8"/>Nobility; and that under pretence of defending the Kingdom againſt the Turk, they encreaſed and multiplied German Garriſons in every place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being at the pains of conſidering whether they were a Charge to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Countrey. Theſe Troops liv'd in no better Diſcipline than they uſed to do in <hi>Germany;</hi> and the provoked People did not fail to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on all occaſions. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> were alſo ſenſible, that they ſtrengthen'd the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Party by all means; and that they filled their Countreys with <hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Prieſts, as we call them, and New Churches. As they knew that they could not hope to be tolerated, if the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſhould become ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Miſtreſs of the Kingdom; 'twas feared leſt they ſhould make uſe of the firſt occaſion that they could meet with to gratifie themſelves in this. When the Laws and the Antient Uſages of the Countrey met with any oppoſition by the Precautions which the Emperors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to take againſt the ill humour of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> they always interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Laws and Uſages in favour of what they deſign'd to do. The <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> oppoſed all this in the Diets of the Kingdom, to the utmoſt of their power;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110070:9"/>but as they had always the worſt on't, their Efforts became every day more feeble. This was the reaſon that in the Year 1673. under the Reign of <hi>Leopold Ignatius,</hi> who mounted the Throne in 1655. the Roman Catholick and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Party openly declared and teſtified by their Diſcourſes, and by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that for the Catholick Religion to be the ſole Religion in all <hi>Hungary,</hi> and Abſolute and Hereditary Authority were according to them two things which they were in the wrong to controvert with the Emperor.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe mutual Diſcontents a part of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Nobility was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of ſerving themſelves cunningly of this Diſpoſition of Minds, to advance their particular Intereſts. Thoſe among them that were in favour with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, made uſe of his Authority to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their Deſigns; and the other whom ſtanding by the Laws and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of their Countrey had rendred agreeable to the People, made advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the kindneſs that their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had for them, without giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the trouble of conſidering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Conduct was conformable to Equity, and to the Obedience which they owed to their Kings. It is even ſaid, that to procure themſelves a Sanctuary, in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110070:9"/>caſe of need, they had Intelligence with the Port; and that ſometimes to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil the Emperor with the <hi>Grand-Signior,</hi> they made Incurſions upon the <hi>Turks Lands;</hi> the blame whereof they laid on the German Garriſons, who were no ways concern'd in it, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Imperialiſts.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate were the Spirits and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>Hungary,</hi> as far as can be learned from thoſe who have given the Hiſtory of them, about the time that <hi>Emeric Count of Tekely</hi> came into the World; which was in 1656. a year after <hi>Leopold Ignatius</hi> was Crowned King of <hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Father <hi>Stephan Tekely</hi> Count of <hi>Kerſmark,</hi> Hereditary Great Bailiff of <hi>Arwa,</hi> and Baron of <hi>Shafnits,</hi> was one of the Richeſt Lords of Upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> where we are aſſured he had 300000 Livres Revenue, a Sum conſiderable any where elſe for a private Man, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a Countrey where Money is ſcarce, and where every thing that's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Life is very cheap. This Lord profeſſed the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion, and took care to bring up his Son therein. He gave him the beſt Education that he could, in a place where Ingenious Men are rare, and where all the Imployment of the Nobility conſiſts in going a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and making merry one with another.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110070:10"/>That which might be of greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for him was the cuſtom of riding, which is uſed there by Perſons of Qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from their Infancy. Being of a robuſt complexion he eaſily accommodated himſelf to this exerciſe, which was of great uſe to him, in the great Marcheswh<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he has ſince been frequently obliged to make, to ſurprize his Enemies, or to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from their hands.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the firſt years of the Life of <hi>Emeric</hi> paſſed in the amuſements of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, or the Recreations of moſt tender Youth, the affairs of <hi>Hungary</hi> were every day more and more embroiled. <hi>George Ragotski</hi> Vaivode of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> in the Year 1656 gave occaſion to Troubles which are not yet ended. He without the knowledge of the Port entred <hi>Poland</hi> with 30000 Men, which <hi>Charles Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> had almoſt quite ſubdued, a little before; but that he was not in caſe to keep it, and would rather leave it to <hi>Ragotski,</hi> than to <hi>John Caſimir</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> whom he came to drive out of it, but <hi>Ragotski</hi> was defeated by the <hi>Polanders,</hi> with whom he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to make a diſhonourable Peace; the Tartarians alſo cut off 2000 of the Reſidue of his Army, and took a great many Priſoners, as they were going home. But that which was more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110070:10"/>to him was, that the Port, exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated againſt this Prince, who was their Vaſſal, and engaged to undertake no War without his permiſſion, ſent an Army into <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> to puniſh him for his Diſobedience. <hi>Ragotski</hi> hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Battel with him, loſt his life with it.</p>
               <div n="1660" type="year">
                  <p>He had in vain implor'd the Emperors ſuccour, who would have him firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up to him the Counties of <hi>Zathmar</hi> and <hi>Zambolich,</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi> The Vaivodes of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> held them of the Kings his Predeceſſors, on condition that they ſhould never deliver them to the Turks. The Emperor fear'd leſt theſe laſt ſhould ſeize upon them, and that afterwards it would not be ſo eaſie to recover them out of their hands; and the States of <hi>Hungary</hi> preſſed him on their part to keep ſome Troops on the Frontiers of the Kingdom for the ſafety of their Countrey, and to endeavour for the ſame reaſon to retake theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries whatever it ſhould coſt. But as the Deliberations of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> are ordinarily very ſlow, and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ill regulated, <hi>Ragotski</hi> periſht, as has been ſaid, before the Motion of the Imperial Troops could give any Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in favour of the unhappy Vaivode. Beſides this, the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110070:11"/>ſo ſtrongly preſſed the Emperor to ſend a Body of an Army to the Frontiers, thought they ſhould be Hungarians, whom they ſhould levy on the place: and were ſurprized to ſee the Count of <hi>Souches</hi> arrive with 10000 <hi>Germans,</hi> as if thoſe of the Countrey had not been capable to defend themſelves, or they were diſtruſtful of them. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Year 1660. the Baron of <hi>Meierperg,</hi> who had been ſent Envoy to the Vaivode to oblige him to reſtore the Counties of <hi>Zathmar,</hi> and <hi>Zambolich</hi> to the Emperor, heard of his defeat and death, but he did not ceaſe to continue his March to acquit himſelf of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, by addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Francis Ragotski</hi> Son to the deceaſed, and to his Widdow, who were retired into theſe Counties. They not being in caſe to undervalue the Emperors Indignation after that they had drawn that of the <hi>Turks</hi> upon them, conſented to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſed. In the mean while the Count of <hi>Souches</hi> had made his Army to advance, and the <hi>Hungarians</hi> furniſht him Proviſions on free coſt; but as the young <hi>Ragotski</hi> nor his Mother had not agreed on the manner how they ſhould put the Emperor in poſſeſſion of theſe two Provinces, there was great difficulty in it at firſt. He would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110070:11"/>the <hi>Germans</hi> into all Places, and <hi>Ragotski</hi> maintain'd that it was ſufficient that the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Garriſons that were there, had taken an Oath of Fidelity to the Emperor, but he was forc't to yield to receive <hi>German</hi> Troops in <hi>Tockay, Kalo</hi> and <hi>Zathmar,</hi> becauſe they threatned to enter by force, and thoſe Towns were not in caſe to reſiſt them. In the mean while <hi>Erſchot</hi> and <hi>Onod,</hi> two other places of theſe Counties, which were ſtronger, refuſed obſtinately to receive them, and <hi>Souches</hi> could not undertake to force them. From this time the <hi>Hungarians</hi> began to fear more than ever, that they ſhould be ſubjected to an Abſolute or Arbitrary Government, without reſpect to any Law but the Will of its Soveraign. Some Princes and their Miniſters have diſcovered ſtrong Inclinations to aſſume a boundleſs Authority, when they have been ſuffer'd to do it, and it then ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Imperial Council took great ſteps towards it, notwithſtanding its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſlowneſs ſo that they no longer doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it. In the mean while they treated thoſe as Seditious, and Enemies to the State, who durſt ſpeak of the Laws &amp; Priviledges<note n="*" place="margin">Which is the uſual Method the Jeſuits, the great Managers of the Imperial Affairs uſe on all ſuch occaſions.</note>; tho' they proteſted at the ſame time that they had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110070:12"/>no deſign to meddle with them. But the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> whoſe Liberty was not yet wholly deſtroyed, did not ceaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to the utmoſt, all that made any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon them. <hi>Paul Weſſelini</hi> was then <hi>Palatine</hi> of the Kingdom, a Dignity which he held for Life, and which clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed thoſe to whom it was given with almoſt a Soveraign Authority, in Peace and War. This man who perfectly knew the deſigns of the Imperial Court, and that it was not ſafe to reſiſt them openly, feign'd, as is ſaid, a willingneſs to contribute to induce the Princeſs and Prince <hi>Ragotski</hi> to receive <hi>German</hi> Troops in every place; but he cunningly made them underſtand, that if they granted this Article, they would infallibly loſe theſe Lands, and draw upon themſelves the Hatred of all <hi>Hungary. Souches</hi> in vain propoſed to give them aſſurances, that they would ſurrender all thoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when there was no more occaſion to fear the <hi>Turk</hi> on that ſide. They would not even give ear to another Expedient, which was, that they would put into <hi>Erſchet</hi> and <hi>Onod, Hungarian</hi> Garriſons, but who ſhould be paid by the Emperor, and ſhould take an Oath of Fidelity unto him. Nothing could ſatisfie them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Emperor did ſuffer the States of <hi>Hungary</hi> to raiſe Troops in their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110070:12"/>Countrey, and to employ the Revenues of the Kingdom to maintain them.</p>
                  <p>The Imperial General who had reaſon to diſtruſt the Hungarians as they diſtruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; Lodged the reſidue of his Troops in good intrenchments, Having received advice that the Turks beſeiged <hi>Great Waradin</hi> in the County of <hi>Zathmar,</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> he would, according to ſome Hiſtorians, make the beſt of this occaſion, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting German Troops into it. But the Inhabitants, who believed they were ſtrong enough to defend themſelves, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to receive them. They believed that the Germans by aſſiſting them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turks, would ſubdue them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward themſelves on the firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The Proteſtants in the mean time were ſo ill treated in the Places where the Catholicks were the ſtrongeſt; that ſeveral of them would rather venture to fall under the Protection or Dominion of the Turk, who does not force the <hi>Tranſylvanians</hi> to take up the Turban, than be expoſed to the Caprices of a Prince abſolutely governed by the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, a more Barbarous ſort of People, ſaid the Hungarians, than the <hi>Dervices.</hi> They accuſed a <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Wara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> of having declared this dangerous Truth to the People. Other Hiſtorians
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110070:13"/>aſſure us, that the Hungarians did their utmoſt in this occaſion, but that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Miniſters, whom they adviſed of the Importance of that Place, and the danger it was in, neglected to ſend ſuccours thither. The Prince <hi>de Portia</hi> Prime Miniſter, naturally timorous and uncapable of a ready reſolution, thought upon the affairs of the War as ſlowly as could be. Being deſirous to ſhew the Provinces wherein he had Lands, the Poſt that he held next to the Emperor, and to draw preſents from all hands, he was induced to go to ſee <hi>Stiria, Carinthia,</hi> and the Neighbouring Provinces. During this Royal Progreſs the Hungarians demanded ſuccour in vain; and tho' the Hungarians preſſed at the Imperial Court to take Orders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Waradin,</hi> they were little moved with their Prayers: They at laſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Count <hi>de Souches</hi> to ſuccour it, but as he had not wherewith to do it, their Orders were to no purpoſe. This ſmall City, flanked with five good Baſtions, and an advantageous Situation, was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en fourty ſeven days after the Trenches were opened; the Inhabitants having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten nothing that was neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, except their refuſal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome, of the German ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, which were not ſtrong enough to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110070:13"/>fight the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army: The Turks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward put this City into the hands of a <hi>Sangiack,</hi> and made it a Magazine, &amp; a Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer Garriſon againſt the Emperor, But then they made no attempt to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of the reſt of the Lands depending on <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> that the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans had ſeized; either becauſe they would not entirely break with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, or becauſe the good Orders which the Count <hi>de Souches</hi> kept there, had rendred this Conqueſt very difficult for them.</p>
                  <p>This General ſeeing that the Seaſon was advanced, and that the Turks made no Motion, thought of putting his Troops into Winter-quarters. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in fine of the Princeſs <hi>Ragotski,</hi> that <hi>Onod</hi> ſhould receive a German Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; and the Hungarians that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Quarters ſhould be at <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> a City of Upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very averſe from Lodging German Souldiers. The reſt of the Troops were poſted in diverſe Places of the County of <hi>Zathmar.</hi> The Count, as is ſaid, had agreed to enter <hi>Caſſovia</hi> with only a Company of his Guards, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Musketeers. The Burgers ſhould guard the Gates of the City, with two hundred <hi>Heyduques,</hi> or Foot-Souldiers, kept at the Emperors Charge, but who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110070:14"/>were to receive their Orders from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. As <hi>Souches</hi> was upon his March for <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> whether for that he came with too many Men, and with a Train of Artillery, which there was no occaſion for in Winter-Quarters; or whether the Palatine was ſenſible of his fault that he had committed in promiſing the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Entry into a City of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as <hi>Caſſovia</hi> was; or for ſome other reaſons, the People took the fright, and ſaw by the conſequence that it was not without reaſon. When then the Count appear'd they ſhut the Gates, and the Burgers put themſelves in Arms; which forced him to go and lodge near by it at <hi>Saſſaw</hi> in a Countrey Houſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Agria's.</hi> He lodged the Cannon in ſive adjacent Villages, where he diſtributed, the Souldiers. On the Complaints that the Count made of the manner how he had been received, 'twas anſwer'd him in the name of the States, that had been called at <hi>Caſſovia</hi> before his arrival, that they never had received even their Kings, till they had firſt made them ſwear to preſerve their Priviledges, one of the principal whereof was that they ſhould never be forced to receive ſtrange Troops into their Cities, and they could not part with a point of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:110070:14"/>
                  <p>The Germans not only pretended to be lodged, but they would be maintained on free Quarters; as if the Revenues which the Emperor had from <hi>Hungary,</hi> had not been ſufficient to ſuſtain a ſmall Body of an Army, without oppreſſing the People. Where-ever the Troops were, they took away all they could finger without paying for it; and (as it is the cuſtom of Souldiers, who do not obſerve Diſcipline but when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Pay,) they made more waſte than was needful for their maintenance. The Hungarians on their part did not pardon any of theſe Violences, but killed them when they could take them at an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. They complained alſo to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the Quartering of theſe Troops, but no regard was had to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; either becauſe they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they were true, as they were, or becauſe they had a deſign to puſh them on to a Revolt<note n="*" place="margin">Which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Methods which they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy on ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions</note>, that they might thereby have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to treat them as a Conqueſt, and ſo ſeize the great Eſtates of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian Nobility. For in <hi>Hungary</hi> they believed that the Emperors Court was full of Princes and poor Gentlemen, who thirſted after other Mens Eſtates as much
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110070:15"/>as any where in the World. The Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians in the mean time were no leſs apprehenſive of the Army than of the <hi>Turks;</hi> and indeed we are no leſs poor when we are ruined by good Chriſtians, than when by the moſt wicked Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon was publiſht for the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians a Writing which contained a Breviate of the ſubjects of Complaint which they had, the principal Heads where of are theſe. <q>1. That the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of <hi>Hungary</hi> were entirely violated, by ſending of Foreign Troops into a Countrey which its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants could eaſily defend, would they make uſe of their ſtrength: 2 That theſe Troops committed 1000. Violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Cruelties: 3. That the Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians that poſſeſſed ſome Offices, durſt not do all their duty for fear of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Emperor: 4. That they had thwarted all the Reſolutions which the Diet had endeavour'd to take, for the good of the Kingdom, by Intrigues and Menaces: 5. That far from leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Proteſtants a free exerciſe of their Religion, which ſeveral Diets had granted them; they had driven them violently from their Churches, and had abuſed and baniſhed their Miniſters, for no other reaſon but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110070:15"/>they were not of their Princes Religion, which was not done even in <hi>Turky:</hi> That whereas one of the greateſt Priviledges of the Hungarian Nobility bears, that whatever Crime they were Guilty of, it ſhould not be tried but by a Judge of the Countrey, it had often been removed before German Judges.<note n="*" place="margin">Note this as the 3d. Method of enſlaving free Countries.</note> 7. That for Crimes, which they accuſed ſome private men of, they had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to puniſh the whole Kingdom without diſtinguiſhing the Innocent from the Guilty: 8. That the Revenues which the Emperor received whether of the Mines, Exciſe or other Rights were more than ſufficient to maintain the Troops that were ſent thither from time to time, yet they were not at all paid, which obliged them to commit great extorſions on the Hungarians, or make Inroads on the Grand Signiors Lands, whoſe ſubjects revenge themſelves afterwards by treating thoſe of the Emperor in the ſame ſort.</q>

                  <p>The Year 1661 which followed theſe firſt troubles, did further verifie all the Complaints. The <hi>Tranſylvanians</hi> after the Death of <hi>George Rogotski,</hi> and the flight of <hi>Francis</hi> his Son, were divided

                  <p>1662. The German Army being return'd into <hi>Hungary,</hi> began to give the Hungarians the ſame apprehenſions as formerly. As they hoped that the Emperor would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new a Truce with the Port, and that they would have no need of Forreign Troops in <hi>Hungary;</hi> they fear'd leſt this Army would endeavour to ſeize all the Places of ſtrength, and ſubject the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to an abſolute Authority. They already had treated the Proteſtants ſo ill, that 'twas eaſie to judge that they had reſolved on their ruine. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholicks, tho zealous, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied otherwiſe to ſee the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion go down, were jealous that under pretence of extirpating Hereſie they began entirely to enſlave the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Nation. 'Twas commonly ſaid, that 'twas thus that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had reduced the <hi>Bohemians.</hi> All the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of <hi>Bohemia</hi> were involved in the ruine of the Proteſtants, and the ſame Armies that they had employed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, had ſerved to oppreſs the Publick Liberty for ever. <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Children would have done the ſame thing in the Low Countreys; but ſeven of thoſe Provinces, who had the Courage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them, had in fine ſhook off the Yoak
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110070:17"/>their Tyranny, and their Inhabitants were at this day the moſt free and moſt happy People of <hi>Europe.</hi> One day the Palatine and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Strigonia,</hi> paſſing in the great Market of <hi>Presbourg,</hi> the People ſurrounded them; and ſome of the moſt ſtirring praid them to write to the Emperor, that the Priviledges of their Country did not permit that they ſhould leave Forreign Troops there ſo long. Theſe Lords endeavour'd to ſweeten them, by the Promiſe that they made, that they would getrepreſented to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror what they deſired. 'Tis not known whether they did it, but the Council at <hi>Vienna</hi> gave no Orders for the Army to return into <hi>Germany;</hi> and the Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans refuſed abſolutely to furniſh them Proviſions, unleſs they paid for them, and ſhut the Gates of their Cities when they thought to come thither to take up their Winter Quarters. When they returned from <hi>Tranſylvania Raimond</hi> Count of <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> who commanded them, made them encamp near <hi>Tokai,</hi> expecting that the Emperor ſhould mark out the places, where he meant they ſhould be lodged In the mean while a great many Souldiers died of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue and Hunger, becauſe there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing prepared for their ſubſiſtance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of Money, or ill admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110070:18"/>of it, or that they had ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly depended on the Liberality of the Hungarians.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor being inform'd of the ill condition of his Army, and how they were treated by the People of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> ordered ſome of the principal Lords of the Countrey to come inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Vienna.</hi> Among thoſe were the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Strigonia,</hi> and <hi>Francis Nadaſti</hi> Preſident of the Soveraign Council, who by the Emperors Order, jointly with thoſe others who were made come to <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſought out means of Subſiſtance for the Imperial Troops. After they had concluded what they were to do, they return'd into <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Nadaſti</hi> prevailed with them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſick Souldiers into Hoſpitals, and to furniſh the reſt Proviſions and Lodging for ſome time. But the Hungarians grew quickly weary of theſe troubleſome Gueſts, and returned to their firſt refuſal, founded upon the ſame reaſons as before. The German Troops, among ſeveral other Inſolences had demoliſht ſome Proteſtant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and plundered their Houſes. The Proteſtants not being of humour to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe evil treatments, got together, and put all the German Souldiers to the ſword who had removed never ſo little
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110070:18"/>from their Quarters. The Emperor thereupon cauſed all thoſe people to be attainted of High Treaſon. There need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more to perſuade them, that the Deſign was as much againſt their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Religion as their Perſons, as a Roman-Catholick Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian<note n="*" place="margin">Hiſt. des trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, de Hung. l. 1. p. 26.</note> has well judged, That this reaſoning was not far from Truth. <q>The Emperor, adds he, who pretends to ſo great Piety, receives blindly all the Counſels that are given him for the Glory of God, and the extirpation of Hereſie; without conſidering that thoſe that inſpire theſe ſentiments into him, [laudable in appearance, but dangerous in execution,] are moved thereto rather by humane conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than for the Intereſt of Heaven; and that they ſeek leſs to eſtabliſh the Worſhip of the true Religion, than to preſerve the Hereticks goods for themſelves, which they had obtain'd the Confiſcation of.</q>

                  <p>Baron <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Goes</hi> was gone to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſwar</hi> on the Emperors ſide to treat with <hi>Ali</hi> Baſſa, and the Accommodation was reckoned eaſie, becauſe the Turks only demanded two things. They only required that a Fort ſhould be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht which Count <hi>Nicholas de Serin</hi> had cauſed to be built upon the <hi>Mure,</hi> which diſcharges its ſelf into the <hi>Save,</hi> that they might bring in thither the Booties which Rovers took from the Turks. They demanded further that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſhould call home his Troops that were in <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> and the Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Counties. Yet in the mean while all the Year was ſpent in ſending and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Courriers, without concluding any thing.</p>
                  <p>That ſame Year the Emperor made a ſevere Regulation, for the Marching and Quartering of Souldiers, which might have prevented many of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders had it been obſerved, For this end they ſhould have paid the Army
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110070:19"/>well, and treated the Souldiers with the ſame ſeverity that they puniſht the Diſobediences of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> when they fell into the hands of the Imperial Comiſſaries.

They offered in vain to pay all their charge, they would by no means truſt people, that never kept their word but when they found it for their purpoſe. Beſides tho they had agreed to furniſh Forrage for nothing to the Cavalry, it made ſo great deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that they were forced to pay for it.

The <hi>Germans</hi> who could not give any reaſon of their conduct, endeavour'd to maintain it by violence. They endeavoured to break open the Gates on the eighth of <hi>December;</hi> but the Inhabitants, who had called ſome of the Neighbouring Trained Bands to their aſſiſtance, charged them very roughly, and a great many were left dead on the place on both ſides. The like Quarrels happened in other places in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where the Germans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the like Inſolences, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd the Emperor to withdraw the greateſt part in the middle of Winter, for fear leſt the deſperate <hi>Hungarians</hi> ſhould put theſe Ill-diſciplin'd Souldiers to the ſword in every place.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who had beheld this Negotiation with grief, becauſe it was not all communicated to them, were not at all ſorry that it came to nothing. It ſeem'd hard to to them, that in a thing that concerned the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary</hi> only, two German Envoys were employed, who by the Orders of the Emperor, and without imparting it to the States, made Treaties whereupon the Repoſe or Ruine of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> depended.

The Garriſon conſiſted but of 3000 Foot and 500 Horſe, which was not at all able to defend a Place half-fortified, againſt an Army of above 70000 Men having no hopes of being relieved.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110070:25"/>of this deſign, and engaged to favour it with all their Forces. <hi>Montecuculi</hi> a great Temporiſer, and very unfit for ready or bold Enterpriſes, whether he followed his Natural Inclination, or through Jealouſie, wholly diſapproved this deſign; under pretence that the Troops would be ruined if they encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Moraſſes ſo early, and that they would be rendred uncapable of acting in the time when they ſhould be moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. But this deſign having been propoſed in the Emperors Council of War was approved there, becauſe they believed that by the Conqueſt of <hi>Caniſa</hi> they might facilitate a Peace; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they came to keep what they had got on both ſides, during this War, or that they made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Caniſa</hi> is a ſmall place, flanked with four Baſtions, but much ſtronger by Nature than by Art, being environed on all ſides with a Moraſs, which cannot be paſt but on a Bridge or Boat, in places where the Water is deep enough. When they ſhould have aſſembled their Troops neceſſary firſt to Block up this place, and afterward to attack it, before the Turks could ſuccour it, there was almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing found in a readineſs, and the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who were accuſtomed to go as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110070:25"/>late out of their Winter Quarters as they could, did it with ſo much ſlowneſs, that they could not profit by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that the Ice would have afforded them, had they been more early. They could not march till about the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and the Turks who had time to diſcover the Enterpriſe, put out all uſeleſs perſons out of it. When they approacht the Place, the Generals, who had repreſented this Enterpriſe as very eaſie, in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution found difficulties which they did not at all foreſee, or which they were not in caſe to ſurmount, after they had undervalued them in a Council of War. They could indeed diminiſh the Water of the Moraſs, by cutting ſome Banks, but it was not poſſible for them to dry it wholly. But they muſt ſeek Bavines and Earth from a far, and the Souldiers could ſcarce endure this fatigue. The Generals were, the Count of Strozzi for the Emperors Troops; that of <hi>Serin</hi> for the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Croats;</hi> and that of <hi>Hollac</hi> for the Auxiliary Troops; and by ill luck they were almoſt never of one Opinion. The firſt was brave in his perſon; even to raſhneſs, but high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited, and unfit to command in chief. The ſecond fearleſs in fight in the open Field, but did not underſtand the way of Befieging and Attacking Places. The
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110070:26"/>third void of experience in Arms, gave no mark of Judgment but in contradicting others. There needed not ſo much to fruſtrate this Enterpriſe, even tho' the Garriſon ſhould not have defended its ſelf with that vigor with which it did. About the end of <hi>March,</hi> the Siege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet much advanced, the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were informed that the Vizier ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in great Marches, to come to the relief of the place; and on reiterated advices that they had received, they raiſed the Siege and retreated with ſo great precipitation, that they left a conſiderable quantity of Proviſions and Ammunition in their Lines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Achmet</hi> did not content himſelf with having made them raiſe the Siege of <hi>Caniſa,</hi> he would further take the Fort of <hi>Serin,</hi> * on the other ſide of the River <hi>Mure.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fort <hi>Sereni</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> This Fort was ſituated on the ſteep ſide of a Hill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt the Ford of the <hi>Mure,</hi> envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with ſome Paliſadoes, and ſome Works of Earth, with deſign, as has been ſaid, to ſhelter the Priſes which the <hi>Croats</hi> had taken from the Turks. The Free-booters having been often ſtopped at the Paſſage of the River, made <hi>Nicholas</hi> Count of <hi>Serin</hi> think of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110070:26"/>building this Fort on the other ſide, as a ſhelter for them,</p>
                  <p>The Grand Vizier employed all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesto carry ſo uncouſiderable a Poſt, and the Imperial Army which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiged <hi>Caniſa,</hi> being advanced on the other ſide of the River, were firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to defend it, to hinder the Turks from paſſing the <hi>Mure</hi> in this place. Count <hi>Peter Serin,</hi> with ſome <hi>Croats</hi> came at that time to ſuccour his Brother, having left the Count <hi>de Straſoldo</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Carleſtadt.</hi> The two Armies were encamped one over againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aſſoon as the Grand Vizier endeavoured to maintain the Attacques, by new Troops, the Imperialiſts took care to relieve the Garriſon. A Body of Turks having one day paſſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Count <hi>Strozzi</hi> went againſt them, and charged them with ſo much Vigour, that he conſtrained them to repaſs with loſs; but in this action he was wounded with a Musket Shot, whereof he died. In fine after a Months obſtinate defence, (without <hi>Montecuculi</hi>'s, who commanded the Body of the Imperial Troops, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any regard to them, tho Count <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> of <hi>Serin</hi> had ſent to him ſeveral times to demand ſuccours,) the Turks took the Fort by aſſault, and were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed afterward to paſs the River; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110070:27"/>having gain'd the Fort, they could ſafely run over all the Peninſula that lies between the <hi>Mure</hi> and the <hi>Drave,</hi> and which was then under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Nicholas de Serin:</hi> They could go ſtraight to <hi>Grats</hi> and alarm all <hi>Italy.</hi> The Imperial Army having foreſeen their deſign, entrenched, and had made Redoubts from place to place, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the paſſage with the Turks, who deſpairing of gaining it, marched ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. Count <hi>Nicholas de Serin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd much of <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> who had refuſed him ſuccour, but had no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. He likewiſe in vain demanded to command in Chief a Body of a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Army, they would not hear him ſpeak of it, which made him quit the ſervice ſhortly after. 'Twas good luck for the Chriſtians, that the Vizier was not reſolute to paſs the River in that place; becauſe the Imperaliſts began to want Powder, and Proviſions became ſo ſcarce in their Camp, that ſeveral Souldiers died of Hunger. The <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſoon after ſent a great Quantity of Powder; and decamping from thence, the Army was in a fairer way to have Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while Count de <hi>Souches</hi> got ſome advantage over the Turks on the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> of whom
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110070:27"/>he beat ſeveral Parties, and retook <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice</hi> and <hi>Lewents,</hi> with the ſame eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as they had loſt it. He alſo defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Baſha of <hi>Buda,</hi> and ran all over even to the Gates of <hi>Strigonia.</hi> But theſe advantages were of ſmall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if they had not hindred the Grand Vizier from executing his deſigns. He endeavoured to enter the Hereditary Countries, and particuarly <hi>Auſtria,</hi> where there being almoſt no places of ſtrength, he hoped to lay it all waſte.</p>
                  <p>All the Imperial Army, commanded by <hi>Monticuculi,</hi> obſerved his Motions, and followed him every day, yet not daring to offer a Battel. The Turks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encamped on the Brink of the River <hi>Raab,</hi> near a Ford, over againſt a little Village named St. <hi>Godard,</hi> the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts entrenched on the other ſide. On the laſt of <hi>July</hi> or the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the Night, the Vizier cauſed three Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries to be planted on the Brink of the River, and at break of day they began to Cannon the Imperialiſts; he made ſix thouſand choſen Men of his Troops paſs over under the ſhelter of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and ſent others after them inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cover them. <hi>Monticuculi</hi> had draw up his Army in Battalia, upon a Heighth, with the greateſt part of his Army, and had ſent but a few Troops
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110070:28"/>to oppoſe the Turks paſſage. Theſe laſt attacqued them ſo furiouſly, that in a very little time they put them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to flight, ſo that ſome of them that fled carried the news of the Defeat of the Imperial Army, as far as <hi>Grats.</hi> In the mean while <hi>Monticuculi,</hi> if we believe the French Relations, did not move from the place, for fear of loſing the advantagious ground he ſtood upon, and all the Turkiſh Army had paſſed, without any hindrance from him, if the Count <hi>de Coligni</hi> and the Marqueſs, <hi>de la Feuillade,</hi> without expecting his Orders, had not marcht right upon the <hi>Janizaries</hi> that had paſſed firſt, and charged them with that briskneſs, that they put them into diſorder at the firſt brunt, and made them retreat toward the River. Some German Regiments, being aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee ſtrangers defend their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey more couragionſly than themſelves, followed the Example of the French, and forced the Turks to repaſs the <hi>Raab</hi> in diſorder, and with great loſs. The Vizier durſt not paſs over himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his men, but appearing on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back on the other ſide of the River, he encouraged them with Hand and Voice. Yet do what he could, he could not make them rally, and he loſt ſixteen thouſand Men, becauſe the brink of the River
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110070:28"/>on his ſide was of difficult acceſs, and ſteep almoſt every where, After this loſs, he was ſo frightned that he decam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the following night, without carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his Cannon, fearing leſt the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts, ſhould entirely defeat his Army, if they ſhould attacque them in the fright they were in. Yet <hi>Monticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi,</hi> maugre the advice of the French and of ſeveral others, contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with this advantage, without dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to follow them, tho the loſs of the Imperialiſts was very unconſiderable. The Vizier retreated under the Cannon of <hi>Strigonia,</hi> and continued there ſome time, to hinder the Imperial Army from attempting the Seige of <hi>Newhauſſel. Montecuculi,</hi> who acted always to the ſureſt, durſt not indeed attempt any thing, and his Conduct was ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved at <hi>Vienna,</hi> that the Emperor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him General Lieutenant of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Count <hi>Peter de Serin</hi> is accuſed of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed two great faults this Year. The firſt of ſeparating from Count <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoldo</hi> Commandant of <hi>Carleſt adt,</hi> in the abſence of the Count <hi>de Averſperg,</hi> in ſtead of entring <hi>Boſnia</hi> with him after the defeat of the Baſha: Which uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated <hi>Scraſoldo</hi> to do any thing. The other is that he had in vain attempted to hinder the Turks from going a foraging
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110070:29"/>with his <hi>Croats,</hi> and two thouſand Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Horſe, which <hi>Montecuculi</hi> had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him for that purpoſe. After the death of his Brother, which happened in hunting, without being well known how, a little after the taking of his Fort; he did not fail to ſucceed him in the Dignity of Ban, or Viceroy of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia, Croatia,</hi> and <hi>Sclavonia;</hi> tho the report runs that the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which would have it believed that a Boar had deſtroyed him, had cauſed him to be aſſaſſinated. He had alſo deſired the Government of <hi>Carleſtadt,</hi> but it was refuſed him. 'Tis ſaid that the death of his Brother and this refuſal made him diſguſt the Emperors ſervice, and from that time he began to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foundations for a new Grandeur. As the evil that is ſpoken of him is founded on what his Enemies have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht, before and after he was put to death, it is not ſafe to believe all that is ſpread in the World, tho we cannot diſprove it.</p>
                  <p>We are aſſured that from that time, he joyned with the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> in whom he ſaw great ſigns of diſcontent, as to the Imperial Court. About the end of Summer, he went to the Bath of <hi>Trenſchin,</hi> with all his Family, at the ſame time when the Widdow of <hi>George
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110070:29"/>Ragotski</hi> arrived there with the Prince her Son, <hi>Weſſelini</hi> was there alſo, and Negotiated a Marriage betweeen <hi>Francis Ragotski</hi> and the Daughter of Count <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin.</hi> Some Hiſtorians ſay, that 'twas thus that they formed the firſt project of a Conſpiracy, whereof we ſhall ſpeak afterwards.</p>
                  <p>However it be theſe Lords began to gain the Favour of the Hungarian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of the Counties of <hi>Zathmar</hi> and <hi>Zambolich.</hi> The Princeſs of <hi>Ragotski</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe with her Children had embraced the Roman Catholick Religion, at the Inſtigation of the Emperor, had taken away their Churches, and had ſeized the fonds whereupon the Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Miniſters was aſſigned, and had diſtributed the revenue to thoſe whom her promiſes or evil treatment had engaged to make profeſſion of the Roman-Catholick Religion. It was whiſpered to the Proteſtant Miniſters, that if they required what had been tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away from them, it ſhould be granted them, provided they employed the Count de <hi>Serin</hi> to interceed for them. They did not fail to make uſe of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and <hi>Ragotski,</hi> in conſideration of his Father-in-Law reſtored them their Churches, and cauſed the Miniſters to be paid the Arrears of their Penſion,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110070:30"/>with a promiſe that they ſhould thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be punctually paid. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who thought they were very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in Roman-Catholick States, when they were promiſed the exerciſe of their Religion, and that their Paſtors ſhould have whereupon to ſubſiſt, received what <hi>Rogotski</hi> granted them as a ſignal favour, and teſtified that they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſerve him with their Goods and Lives.</p>
                  <p>After the Victory of St. <hi>Godard,</hi> the Emperor, who had an extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to make Peace, reapt no other advantage by it but that he thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Turks to enter into new Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations with him. Thoſe that had been begun at <hi>Themiſwar</hi> were only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the War. The Emperors Agents remain'd all that time near the Grand Vizer, who had retained them to renew it when he ſhould find it for his purpoſe. Having told them that it would be no hard matter at that time to enter upon ſome accommodation, he permitted them to give advice of it to the Emperor. This Prince preſently embraced this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and ſent orders to <hi>Montecuculi</hi> to commit no acts of Hoſtility. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier did the ſame on his part, and the Treaty was concluded ten days after the Battel of <hi>Raab.</hi> Beſides the ſecret Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110070:30"/>it was agreed that the Emperor ſhould withdraw all his Troops from <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> whereof <hi>Abaffi</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Maſter unmoleſted, and that the Eſtates thereof, in caſe he ſhould die, ſhould make an Election of a new Vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vode, without any moleſtation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ordinary manner; that the Turks ſhould keep what they had taken, demoliſhing <hi>Zekelheid,</hi> on condition that they would not repair the Fort of <hi>Serin:</hi> That the Emperor, to whom the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of the Lands, of the two Counties of <hi>Zathmar</hi> and <hi>Zambolich,</hi> which <hi>Ragotski</hi> enjoyed, had been given up, might notwithſtanding build a Fort on the <hi>Tibiſque</hi> to cover them: That this Truce ſhould be for 20 years, and that in order to ratifie it, the Emperor ſhould ſend to the Port an Ambaſſador, with a Preſent of 200000 Florens.</p>
                  <p>When theſe Articles were publiſht very different judgments were made of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome blamed the Emperor for this, that he was ſo far from reaping any fruit from a glorious victory, that he abandoned to the Turks, <hi>Tranſylvania, Newhauſſel</hi> and a conſiderable part of <hi>Hungary.</hi> They were aſtoniſht that an Army of 40000 choſen Men, paid in a great partby others, had been made uſe of to no other end than to preſerve to the Infidels the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110070:31"/>Conqueſts they had made. The Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Miniſters excuſed themſelves with neceſſity, and they ſaid that they choſe rather to make a Peace that was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honourable than a War that would be deſtructive to the Emperor. Yet ſome have believed that the principal reaſons of this Peace were, on one hand, the Fear the Emperor was poſſeſſed with, that he ſhould not be long ſuccoured by the Troops of the Empire, who did not look upon his advancement with a good Eye: and on the other ſide the humour of the Prince of <hi>Porcia,</hi> prime Miniſter to the Emperor, ſtrongly inclined to a Peace, becauſe he was not capable to maintain himſelf in the credit he was in during the War. Add to this, that <hi>Leopold</hi> himſelf thought on nothing elſe than to receive <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> his Spouſe, and fear'd that if <hi>Philip</hi> IV. ſhould die while the Empire was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil'd in the Hungarian War, the French King would invade his Eſtates.</p>
                  <p>None were ſo troubled at ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Treaty as the Hungarians. They ſaw themſelves thereby abandon'd to the Turks, who in the midſt of the Peace would not fail to work them 1000 miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieſs by means of the new Garriſon of <hi>Newhauſſel.</hi> The two Counts of <hi>Serin</hi> and the <hi>Croats,</hi> who were in their Intereſts,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110070:31"/>diſapproved it extreamly, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the firſt to advice the War, and the Fort of <hi>Serin</hi> having been part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a cauſe of it, they ſaw well that they ſhould be deſpiſed during the Peace, or even hated as the Authors of a War de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>Some Hungarians were ſo bold as to rob the Secretary to the Emperors Reſident, near the Grand Vizier, and to take away from him the Treaty of Peace, which he carried to <hi>Vienna.</hi> This action and the complaints of the Hungarians, who ſaid openly, that they had ſhamefully abandoned almoſt all Lower <hi>Hungary</hi> to the Turks, and a part of the Upper to the Inſolences of the Garriſon of <hi>Newbauſſel,</hi> obliged the Emperor to cauſe ſome of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Lords of <hi>Hungary</hi> to come to <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> to appeaſe them. The Prince of <hi>Lobkovits</hi> Prime Miniſter, after the death of <hi>Porcia,</hi> ſpoke to them in name of the Emperor, and endeavoured to make them comprehend that this Peace was abſolutely neceſſary. He added, that the Emperor was ready to withdraw the German Troops from the reſt of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> provided the Hungarians repaired the Fortifications of ſeveral little places near were put therein. Theſe Lords could
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110070:32"/>anſwer nothing to this, but that they would communicate what they had ſaid to the firſt Diet, who ſhould not fail af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to ſend Deputies to <hi>Vienna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while Count <hi>Gautier Leſle</hi> was diſpatcht to the Port, who went to <hi>Adrianople</hi> with the Grand Vizier, who led him as in Triumph, to ratifie the Treaty of Peace there. The Grand Signior ſent on his part to <hi>Vienna, Cara Mahomet Baſſa,</hi> for the ſame deſign, and brought the Count <hi>de Leſle</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> to receive him there with more State.</p>

                     <hi>Lobkovits</hi> Propoſitions were anſwered by writing in the beginning of the Year 1665. The Hungarians repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that the Kingdom had reaſon to complain that they had concluded a Peace with the Turk, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the States, that the Kings of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> had no Right to do it: That it was not an eaſie thing to hinder the Inroads of the Turks, that the German Soldiers, whom they would ſend againſt them, would do little leſs miſchief than they: That in fine they could not be reſolved to ratifie a Peace ſo diſadvantageous to their Countrey, nor ſuffer themſelves to be robbed by ſtrangers.</p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Lobkovits</hi> remonſtrated to them anew, the neceſſity they were under to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110070:32"/>make Peace with the Turks, and told them, that they could not complain that the Negotiation of Peace had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the States of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſince the Emperors Agents had communicated their Inſtructions to them at <hi>Presbourgh;</hi> he added that it was true that they had concluded a Peace with great haſte, but that that was done to take advantage of the good Diſpoſition of the Vizier, which might change: That as to the reſt, the Hungarians ſaw themſelves deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby from all the horrours, that ſo deadly a War would draw after it, which ſhould be more cauſe of joy to them than the loſs of <hi>Newhauſſel</hi> was of ſorrow: That in fine the Emperor would build Forts near <hi>Newhauſſel,</hi> and put Troops therein, to oppoſe the Inroads of the Garriſon.</p>
                  <p>The Hungarians ſeeming better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied than at firſt, did not fail to reply to <hi>Lobkovits,</hi> that the Officers that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Troops, ſhould be of their own Nation then: That he needed take no other Expedient to curb the Garriſon of <hi>Newhauſſel,</hi> than to reaſſemble under ſome Colours, a great number of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian Soldiers, who were ſpread throughout the Kingdom, and without Employs, That they might put thoſe people in places of <hi>Hungary</hi> expoſed to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110070:33"/>the Turks, inſtead of the Germans, who did not much leſs miſchief than the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, through want of Diſcipline and of being paid. The Emperor having at laſt agreed to theſe Articles from the Mouth, they ſubſcribed the Peace, and carried back the Crown of the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary</hi> to <hi>Presbourg,</hi> which had been carried to <hi>Vienna</hi> during the War. The Emperor diſmiſt the greateſt part of his Troops, and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Baden Dourlach,</hi> Generals of the Troops of the Empire, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderable preſents; after which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and delivered their Troops to thoſe that had given them.</p>
                  <p>One would have thought after this, that <hi>Hungary</hi> ſhould enjoy a long Peace, but the Promiſe that was mutually given on one ſide, not to meddle with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Kingdom, and on the other to obſerve the Treaty of Peace, was not kept on either ſide. The Count <hi>de Rothal</hi> Commiſſary General to the Emperor having withdrawn ſome Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Troops from <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there, inſtead of leading them the way to the Hereditary Countreys, placed them anew in the Upper <hi>Hungary</hi> at <hi>Zathmar, Tokai, Kalo</hi> and <hi>Onod,</hi> never minding the Complaints of the Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.

The Hungarians ſeeing that they had not kept their promiſe which they had given them, made Inroads up on the Turks, as if the War had ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued; they made complaints of it <hi>Vienna,</hi> and reveng'd themſelves cruelly on all the Frontiers of Chriſtian <hi>Hungary</hi> One of the firſt Hungarians that mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Horſe, to violate the Treaty of Peace, was Count <hi>Palaffi Imbre,</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make the fault be charged upon <hi>Weſſelini</hi> the Palatine, his particular Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as if he had done nothing but by his Order. <hi>Palaffi</hi> not being believed, or the Council of <hi>Vienna</hi> not judging it fit to act againſt <hi>Weſſelini,</hi> he was ſo far tranſported, that he attempted to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and burn the Palatines Lands; but <hi>Ragotski</hi> and <hi>Abaffi</hi> taking this laſts part hindred <hi>Palaffi</hi> from executing any thing, though he had demanded aſſiſtance from, the Turks, and had offered them his Son, and the Fort of <hi>Debin</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, as Pledges of his Fidelity. The diſturbances of the Hungarians among themſelves, which ſhould have been determined by the Laws of the Countrey, gave occaſion to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to repreſent them as common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers at the Imperial Court, who
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110070:34"/>ſeeking but a plauſible pretence, to leave the German Garriſons that were there among them, did not fail to make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by what preſented it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Hungarians were further accuſed of having made ſeveral attempts on the perſon of their King. According to the Laws of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the King ſhould call a general Diet of the Kingdom every third year, and be preſent himſelf at it, to regulate the Affairs of State. The Diet then having been called in form at <hi>Presbourg Sept.</hi> 27. 1665. the Hungarians earneſtly prayed that the Emperor would be there, but he abſolutely refuſed it. 'Twas ſaid ſince that there was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy among them to ſeize his Perſon. Whether this was true, or that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror not deſigning to agree to the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling back of the German Troops, which he knew well they would demand of him, would not for this reaſon put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into their hands, he gave them new matter of complaint by this refuſal.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1666"/> In the beginning of the Year 1666. the Soveraign Chamber of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> ſollicited by the complaints of the Inhabitants of <hi>Zathmar,</hi> ſent ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to complain that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Spaar,</hi> who commanded the Troops that were put into that place, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the Inhabitants to give him a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110070:34"/>of Money, as if it were to pay off the Garriſon, but that he converted it to his own uſe. The ſame Deputies had order to repreſent the Extorſions and Violences of all the German Troops, and to demand that he would call them home according to the promiſe that he had made to them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the reaſons of not calling them back, that have been already related, there, came pat for the Emperors purpoſe, advice that the Hungarian Proteſtants had choſen Heads, to oppoſe the progreſs of the Roman Religion in Upper <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> by the Example and Authority of the Family of <hi>Ragotski.</hi> Whether this advice were true or not, there needed no more to ſtop the mouths of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, who durſt not take the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants part.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are of humour to make Conſpiracies, or what men would make to be ſuch, do not ſtop at the firſt, unleſs they have a mind to prevent them. Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be puniſhed for their Projects that have not ſucceeded, if they ſhould come to be diſcovered, they endeavour all anew to put thoſe, againſt whom they have conſpired, in a ſtate uncapable to do them any hurt. The Counts <hi>Nadaſti</hi> and <hi>Serin</hi> formed once more a deſign of ſeizing the Emperors perſon, who muſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:110070:35"/>paſs by near <hi>Puttendorf,</hi> going to meet his Empreſs. Count <hi>Serin</hi> who brought his Daughter to <hi>Ragotski,</hi> to conſummate the Marriage, was under this pretence come into <hi>Hungary</hi> with a numerous Train. They had likewiſe publiſht that the Turks would make ſure of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Paſs, to ſend Troops into <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia</hi> againſt the Venetians, with whom they were ſtill at Wars, and that the Emperor favour'd it under-hand. To op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this deſign of the Infidels, they had almoſt raiſed 500 Men, for whom they had aſſign'd <hi>Puttendorf</hi> as the place of Randezvouſe. The Emperor muſt ride Poſt near by that with the Prince of <hi>Lobkovits,</hi> Maſter of his Houſe, and twelve Horſe-men; and it would have been eaſie for thoſe Troops to inveſt him, if the Emperor had not paſſed ſooner than the Conſpirators believed he would, and before their Troops were arrived. The Emperor met happily with his new Spouſe, and led her to <hi>Vienna,</hi> where the Marriage was conſummated on <hi>Decemb.</hi> 5. 1666.</p>

The Emperor was not ignorant they would not have given ſo many freſh on-ſets on this Article, but to recover their Liberties and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; which perhaps they might make uſe of in a manner diſadvantageous to his Houſe, if he ſhould happen to die; and the Hungarians could not endure, that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſhould from thenceforth look upon <hi>Hungary</hi> as her Hereditary Countreys, where it ſhould have an Authority little different from that which the Grand Signior has over his Subjects. In the mean while they proteſted on the one hand, that they would no ways infringe the Priviledges of the Hungarian Nation; and on the other, that they had nothing ſo much in their Hearts, as the Glory and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Imperial Houſe. So true it is, that we muſt keep at leaſt in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the Laws of a Society, if we would not quite loſe it.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Francis Weſſelini,</hi> who has ſince been charged by ſome with ſlowneſs and ſoftneſs, becauſe he did not execute the Emperors Orders rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and by others with Infidelity for the ſame reaſon. Perhaps being very
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110070:36"/>ſubject to the Gout, and to other Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, he did not act with a readineſs neceſſary in great Affairs; and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to violate the Laws of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as they would have had him, his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity became ſuſpected. Theſe two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the one upon the other.

Count <hi>Nadaſti,</hi> Preſident of the Soveraign Council, and one of the beſt Qualified Gentlemen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſtood up for the Dignity of Palatin, but the Emperor miſtruſting him, refuſed it, and judged it better for his purpoſe not to fill it in the ſtate he found the Kingdom in then; fearing leſt he whom he ſhould confer it upon, ſhould make uſe of the Authority of his Office to maintain the Priviledges that the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> had for a long time caſt an ill Eye upon.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1668"/> 'Tis ſaid that <hi>Nadaſti,</hi> diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was refuſed a Dignity, which he thought was his due, attempted a third time to kill the Emperor, or to ſeize his perſon. The Expedient was to ſet the Imperial Palace on fire, and to ſtop the Emperor, who would not fail
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:110070:36"/>to depart <hi>Vienna</hi> in great haſte to flee from the Fire. 'Tis added that <hi>Nadaſti</hi> corrupted a Carpenter, who wrought in the new Apartment that the Emperor had cauſed to be made, and which was ſet on fire <hi>Feb.</hi> 23. It is at leaſt very certain, that the Fire ſeized on the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Palace that day, that it was not known at firſt how it happened, and that no effect of this Conſpiracy was ſeen. It has been ſaid ſince, that the Truth of all was diſcovered by Papers and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of <hi>Nadaſti,</hi> who had no body to take his part after his Death. He was likewiſe accuſed of deſigning to Poiſon the Emperor at a Feaſt, to which he had invited all the Imperial Court; and 'tis ſaid that his Wife hindred it, by cauſing to ſerve to the Emperor another Paſty inſtead of that which was poiſoned. He had a mind another time, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome Hiſtorians, to poiſon the Water which that Prince drank, by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dead Dog into it that had died of poiſon. The boldneſs of theſe Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, and many other Circumſtances, made them to be but little believed; it is difficult to judge ſurely of it, on what is ſaid. The Intereſts that Men often have to deſtroy perſons either rich or conſiderable for their Offices, and the great care that has been taken to make
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110070:37"/>them unjuſtly paſs for Traitors, have hindred a great many people from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing credulous in theſe matters; that they look upon almoſt all Conſpiracies that are ſpoken of as fabulous; unleſs thoſe againſt whom they have been made, have been either killed or wounded.</p>
                  <p>The death of Count <hi>d' Averſperg,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Carleſtadt,</hi> bred in the Count <hi>de Serin</hi> a deſire to have his Poſt, by means whereof he would be Maſter of <hi>Croatia.</hi> The Counteſs his Spouſe part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Vienna</hi> with this deſign; but tho' ſhe forgot nothing, to obtain this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for her Husband, ſhe could not compaſs her deſign. It was reſolved at <hi>Vienna,</hi> by little and little, to put the Nobility of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Croatia</hi> out of caſe to come and importune the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, about the obſervation of the Uſages and Laws of their Countrey. For this effect, far from gaining by Graces thoſe whom they ſuſpected to be too much wedded to them, they refuſed them every thing that was in their power to keep from them. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Carleſtadt</hi> was given to <hi>Joſeph</hi> Count of <hi>Haberſtein,</hi> Knight of <hi>Malta;</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Serin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into Upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> to her Son-in-law <hi>Ragotski</hi> in the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:110070:37"/>
                  <p>They ſtill continued their complaints againſt the German Gariſons in that Countrey. Yet they obtain'd no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling of them, nor Juſtice for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries they had committed on the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, for that it was reſolved upon at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to mortifie them as much as was poſſible; to ſuppreſs, as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpake, the Seditious Diſcourſe of the Laws and Priviledges which thoſe people had continually in their Mouths. All this and the not very pliable humour of the Hungarians, made them put ſeveral of the German Souldiers to the Sword, as they had done more than once. The Princeſs <hi>Ragotski,</hi> who was grown a Zealous Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholick, did not ſuffer the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to be well uſed long in her Sons Lands; ſo that People believing that the Emperor, perhaps not being well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>Ragotski,</hi> upon the account of his Father-in-law the Count <hi>de Serin,</hi> would do them ſome Juſtice, they made their Application to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to obtain their being ſupported as at firſt. And they at the ſame time complained of the Diſorders of the German Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>1669. The Hungarians were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed harſhlier than ever on this laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, &amp; were upbraided with all the loſſes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110070:38"/>that were ſuſtain'd in <hi>Hungary</hi> for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Years, as if they had been the cauſes of them. As to what concern'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Father <hi>Emeric,</hi> Confeſſor to the Emperor had ſo exaſperated that Prince againſt Hereſie, that he ſpoke of nothing but their abjuring it, without which they would not hear them more; as if they muſt change their ſentiments or pretend to have others, on things of ſo great importance, by Menaces and harſh uſage.</p>
                  <p>When the Deputies which had carried theſe complaints were returned home, and had inform'd the People of their ill ſucceſs, one might have ſeen all their minds alarm'd, and vainly ſeeeking for remedies for ſo great evils. To let the Germans alone, ſaid they, who treat the Hungarians worſe than the Turks. were to reſolve to live in miſery and contempt, to oppoſe them by force would ſtir up a Civil War, whereof they could not foreſee the end, and whereof the Infidels might reap terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantages.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants in particular knew not wither to turn themſelves, not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to truſt themſelves to the Roman-Catholicks, among whom there were few perſons ſo moderate to bemoan them, if the violences of the Germans
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110070:38"/>had not been extended on the Roman-Catholicks too. The Lutherans and Calviniſts, according to their wont, ſcarcely agreed among themſelves in theſe extremities, and if one of theſe Parties of Proteſtants were ill treated the other would be little concern'd for it.</p>
                  <p>The miſchiefs that were common to all the Hungarians of what Religion ſoever they were, unleſs they were ready for every thing that ſhould be commanded them, without making any uſe of the Judgment that God has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en all men; theſe misfortunes, I ſay, form'd a kind of Union among them. Perhaps alſo the Humour of the Nation equally impatient and peeviſh contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to make a kind of Harmony among their complaints, and ingaged them in common to ſeek Remedies for their evils. The example of the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvanians</hi> among whom there is far greater diverſity of Religions, ſince there are Socinians publickly tolerated, and who live in quiet under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Turk, was a Temptation to them. They reſolved to demand the ſame Protection of the Port by a Deputation ſhameful to Chriſtianity: For, in fine, ſuppoſe that a Chriſtian Prince give to People of the ſame Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110070:39"/>juſt reaſon to believe that they ſhall be better under the Empire of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, than under his; or that Chriſtian Subjects ſhould make ſuch a Judgment without reaſon, which yet is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; however it is a thing that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume tans themſelves have never done with reſpect to the Chriſtians. Behold the Fruits of Efforts, <hi>that were made to ſhake off a Deſpotick Empire over Souls and Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid that the Counts <hi>Nadaſti, Serin, Frangipani,</hi> and <hi>Taptembach,</hi> entred into this Conſpiracy, with almoſt all the richeſt Nobility of <hi>Hungary;</hi> ſome through Ambition or Intereſt; others through hatred to the <hi>German Nation,</hi> which they could not endure in their Lands, ſome few for the ſole Love of the Liberty of the Hungarian Nation; the greateſt part for theſe different Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that were at the ſame time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their Mind.</p>
                  <p>They durſt not ſend Deputies of their Nation, for fear the Emperors Reſident at the Port ſhould ſmell out their deſign too ſoon. They imployed Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, who being under the Protection of the Port could go and come without ſuſpicion. The Deputies were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very well of the Grand Signior at firſt, but as he did nothing but by the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:110070:39"/>Interpoſition of his Prime Vizier, he referred them to this Miniſter, who was then in <hi>Candia.</hi> As he was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily buſied in the Siege of this place, he referred them to his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Pangiotti;</hi> to whom they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to ſay any thing, becauſe it was believed that he favoured the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts. This retarded the Negotiation, but in fine they propos'd to the Vizier to make the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the Port, and to put it under its Protection, on condition that as to the reſt, the Grand Signior would leave them all their Priviledges. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented that it would be eaſie to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from the Obedience to the Emperor, if the Port ſent into <hi>Hungary</hi> an Army of an hundred thouſand Men, to take the places where there were Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Garriſons; during which time the Hungarians for their part, would enter the Hereditary Countries, or oppoſe with a conſiderable Army the Troops that ſhould come from <hi>Germany.</hi> They offered to the Turks to leave them the Places they had conquered; which ſhould ſerve as a Pledge to aſſure them of the Fidelity of the <hi>Hungarians.</hi> The Infidels after they had heard theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions did not think they had offered them enough; they would have them
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:110070:40"/>to put ſeveral Cities into their hands, before they broke entirely with the Emperor, to aſſure them that they would not break, and theſe were the moſt important places of the Kingdom. The Deputies could not yield to this Article, and when they had given ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of it in <hi>Hungary,</hi> they anſwered only, that the Places which the Turkiſh Army ſhould take ſhould continue the Grand Signiors. They could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to give Pledges before they had received ſome ſuccours. The Turks continuing firm in their demands, the Deputies took leave of the Vizier with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having done any thing, and without obtaining any thing in writing to ſhew in <hi>Hungary.</hi> Yet they promiſed them in General Terms to Aſſiſt them as much as they could.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not known whether the Grand Vizier, being ſtill puzled with the Siege of <hi>Candy,</hi> would not engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a new Enterprize, or if the Loſſes which he had ſuſtain'd in this Iſland, or in <hi>Hungary,</hi> diſcouraged him from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing what they propoſed to him; but we are aſſured that <hi>Pangiotti</hi> gave notice of what paſſed to the Emperors Reſident.</p>

About that time the Count <hi>Tattembach</hi> was betrayed, as is ſaid, by one of his Grooms, who had the Copy of a Project that his Maſter had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed ſince the Year 1667. with the Count <hi>de Serin,</hi> to make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Croatia</hi> and <hi>Stiria.</hi> An Officer named <hi>Bukouashi,</hi> was alſo gone to the Port for the Count of <hi>Serin,</hi> to offer her a yearly Tribute for <hi>Croatia</hi> and <hi>Stiria,</hi> if ſhe would aſſiſt him to put himſelf in Poſſeſſion of it.

He had already drawn together what Troops he could, and had writ to his Friends ſeveral Letters that were intercepted. He had thought he could eaſily ſurprize <hi>Copranits</hi> a City of <hi>Croatia,</hi> which he had promiſed to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up to the Turks, but he could not compaſs his end.

He own'd that he had had correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Turks, but that it was only to penetrate the better into their Deſigns, which the Emperor had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him before; that it is further true, that they had made great proffers to him, but he added that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them all.</p>
                  <p>The Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> did not ſuffer it ſelf to be amuſed with ſuch groſs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; it ordered <hi>Spankan</hi> to lay Siege to <hi>Shacketorn,</hi> whither the Count was retreated, with <hi>Frangipani</hi> his Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in law. Not being in caſe to reſiſt, he ſent P. <hi>Marc Forſtal Auguſtin</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to endeavour to find out ſome way of accommodation.

The Place not being in a ſtate of Defence, was taken in a little time, <hi>Serin</hi> and <hi>Erangipani</hi> having abandoned it. In the mean while they took the formers Wife Priſoner there, and plundered their beſt effects. They were gone out with thirty Horſe, with a deſign to caſt themſelves at the Emperors feet, by the advice of the Count of <hi>Keri</hi> who betrayed them, &amp; received them in his Caſtle, whence they were carried Priſoners to <hi>Vienna.</hi> After they were taken, it was not hard matter to reduce the ſmall number that ſided with them in <hi>Croatia</hi> into Obedience.</p>
                  <p>The Lords of <hi>Hungary</hi> that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the ſame Conſpiracy with <hi>Serin</hi> and <hi>Frangipani,</hi> and who had got more Men than they, took the Field too late. Their pretence at firſt was the fear they were in that the Turks had ſome deſign upon <hi>Hungary,</hi> becauſe they had
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:110070:42"/>ordered to find out the Fords of ſeveral Rivers, which were very low that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. They held, notwithſtanding the Emperors Prohibition, who had had advice of it, an Aſſembly at <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> where a great number of Nobility and Deputies from ſeveral Counties of <hi>Hungary</hi> met, they reſolved in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to form a Body of an Army of twelve thouſand Men, eight thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe; to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as they ſaid, the Incurſions of the Turks. The Emperor thereupon cited thoſe that had been at this kind of Diet, and adjourn'd them to meet at <hi>Newſol,</hi> promiſing to ſatisfie their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Complaints. But thoſe that were engaged in this affair, ſaw very well, that the Council of <hi>Vienna</hi> fought only to gain time, and being already reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to defend their Priviledges by Arms, were but little frightned with this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. 'Tis ſaid that <hi>Nadaſti</hi> whom the Emperor did not yet ſuſpect, hindred them ſecretly from obeying his Orders, tho he pretended to make them exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them. The Malecontents made haſte to levy as many Men as they could, to put them under <hi>Ragotski</hi>'s command, who had promiſed to maintain two thouſand Men for himſelf. The thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Counties made for this end an

                  <p>

His Mother would not yield up that place to him, either becauſe of the Money which ſhe kept there, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had not been of the Party. In the mean while thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued faithful to the Emperor met at <hi>Newſol,</hi> but to no purpoſe, becauſe the Demands which the Malecontents made were rejected with diſdain. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that the Proteſtant Churches might be reſtored to them, as having poſſeſſed them peaceably for ſeveral Years? That they would recall all the Germans, and that they ſhould put Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian Souldiers in their place; that the Troops they had raiſed ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue on foot, to make War on the Turks by their particular Authority. We are aſſured that there was joy at <hi>Vienna,</hi> eſpecially when they had taken the Count of <hi>Serin,</hi> and knew that the Turks continued neuter, that they had found out a ſure way to forfeit the Eſtates of the Nobility of <hi>Hungary;</hi> for they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:110070:43"/>as indeed they thought they would take no ſhare in theſe troubles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror who at firſt had demanded ſuccours of the Diet at <hi>Rattisbonne,</hi> and had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it, thanked thoſe who had engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to furniſh him in it, having enough of his own Troops to reduce the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents. The event ſhewed that he was not miſtaken, and he might ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently judge of it, by the little skill the Chiefs had, which appeared in all their conduct. It was as eaſie to conjecture, that the People would not acquit themſelves of their duty as they ought; becauſe that in a Society, where no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has a right to command, and cannot get himſelf fear'd, 'tis rare that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is exact, eſpecially in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>

                     <hi>Ragotski</hi> not being expeditious enough, or not underſtanding the Office he had taken upon him, had no ſucceſs in any thing; the Imperial Troops on the contrary advanced without loſing time, and began to force the Paſſes in Upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> that the Malecontents had ſeized. The Turks would not break with the Emperor, as they had flattered themſelves, and ſome Troops of <hi>Valachia</hi> which <hi>Ragotski</hi> was to have did not come. All this joyn'd with the ſollicitation of his Mother and Father
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:110070:44"/>in-law, who writ Letters to him from Priſon, wherein he adviſed him to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render himſelf to the Emperor; all this, I ſay, was more than enough to make his Sword drop out of his hand. He disbanded his Troops the greateſt part whereof retired into <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi> and his Mother went to <hi>Vienna</hi> to beg his Pardon. She obtain'd it on condition that he would receive an Imperial Garriſon into all Places that belonged to him, which he ſhould maintain on his own Charges.</p>
                  <p>The Principal the Head of Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents having abandon'd them, it was no hard matter for General <hi>Spork,</hi> who commanded an Army of above fifteen thouſand Men, to reduce all the reſt. No place of the Malecontents was ſtrong enough nor provided as it ought, to maintain a Siege againſt him. Even the Hungarians that were no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Conſpiracy were treated as Rebels, as to what concerns the quartering of Souldiers, and the other Inconveniences, which an Army with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Money and Proviſions uſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in Places through which they paſs.

                  <p>In the mean while the Count <hi>de Serin</hi> who at firſt was made to hope he ſhould obtain the Emperors Pardon, grew e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day more Guilty, and his Brother-in-law <hi>Frangipani</hi> is charged with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betrayed him in Priſon, that he might the more eaſily obtain a Pardon for himſelf, and to ſucceed to his Offices. We are aſſured further, that there were found at <hi>Muran,</hi> the City of the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Palatine <hi>Weſſelini,</hi> wherein ſeveral Aſſemblies of the Malecontents had been held, a vaſt number of Papers, in the hands of one <hi>Nagiferents, Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the League.</hi> By theſe Papers they learn'd all the Circumſtances, and Accomplices of the Conſpiracy, which were very pat for the purpoſe, of the Miniſters thirſting after the Eſtates of others, eſpecially the richeſt of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It is ſurprizing that this <hi>Nagiferents,</hi> who was forc't to deliver thoſe Papers to the Prince of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> did not burn thoſe dangerous evidences of a Plot that had proved abortive, when he ſaw the Place beſeiged.

We will only ſay that in the Diet of <hi>Hungary</hi> that was aſſembled at <hi>Lentch</hi> the Hungarians, beſides their ancient Complaints, that the German Souldiers made them renew, with a great deal of Grief, demanded according to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertible Priviledges, to be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

They feared that the Hungarian Judges, tho Innocent as to the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy would either find the accuſation ill grounded, or that counterbalancing the Duties of Princes with thoſe of Subjects, they would Judge thoſe Counts as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, at leaſt, as thoſe who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive <hi>Hungary</hi> of all its Priviledges. It was nothing at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to violate the moſt equitable Laws; and thereby to reduce an Infinite Number of Innocent Families to Miſery; on the contrary it was a crime but to complain of it, and an attempt deſerving the utmoſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to defend their Laws, by the ſame way by which they would ruine them. They were not of the ſame Judgment in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Judgments, did not ſuit the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Court. The four Priſoners were condemned to be beheaded for High Treaſon, by Judges of the Emperors appointment: Count <hi>Nadaſti</hi> was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at <hi>Vienna</hi> on <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. 1671.

                  <p>In making their Proceſs, we find, as is ſaid, that almoſt all the beſt qualified Nobility of <hi>Hungary</hi> had ſome hand in the Conſpiracy; ſome for effectually tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering in it, others for not diſcovering it, others again for not oppoſing it as they ought.

Every one took one of theſe three ways, according to the State of his Affairs, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he found himſelf in. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror having notice that ſome had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified themſelves in their Caſtles, with a deſign to defend themſelves by force, againſt the ſearch that might be made for them, ſent General <hi>Heiſter</hi> with thouſand Horſe to ſeize thoſe People.

He did not at all believe that Princes could by Divine Right violate all the Laws, and the People who had choſen them for their good, and not for their deſtruction, ſhould have no right to oppoſe ſome other thing than ſole Patience. He diſtinguiſht by an ill timed notion the Subjects of Chriſtian Princes, and engaged by their Oath and Religion to obſerve certain Laws; from thoſe who obey the Turk, and who are under a kind of Slavery.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:110070:51"/>it was preſently perceiv'd that there was no likelihood of pacifying <hi>Hungary</hi> ſo ſoon. In ſome Aſſemblies which were held for this end within that Realm and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> the <hi>Male-contents</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a general Act of Indempnity with the re-eſtabliſhment of their Priviledges, and of their Churches, and the reparation of their Loſſes, which was far from caſting themſelves upon the <hi>Emperors</hi> Clemency, and expecting what he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe them of his bounty, as it had been expected from them.

                  <p>One of theſe Bodies went a great way from the others to avoid fighting, but <hi>Tekely</hi> made them be followed by ſome Squadrons who overtook them near <hi>Leutſch,</hi> and entirely defeated them, while <hi>Boham</hi> cut in pieces the ſecond, and himſelf defeated the third, ſo that the whole <hi>Imperial</hi> Army was put to the rout. One Party was ſav'd in the Caſtle of <hi>Roſemberg,</hi> which had been abandoned, but they were ſoon taken and put to the Sword. From thence a Detatchment was ſent to ſupport the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who ravaged <hi>Moravia,</hi> and on the other ſide <hi>Colonel

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe Incurſions much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded the <hi>Hereditary Countries,</hi> they not retaining any place, and contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with only pillaging, did nothing diverſive, which might put the <hi>Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> into a condition to be ſettled Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Hungary,</hi> or hinder the <hi>Emperor</hi> from entring it. The <hi>Hungarians</hi> wanted the Art of fortifying Towns, and the means of providing them with what was neceſſary for a long reſiſtance, ſo that it was more eaſie to take them, than to keep them. Nor were they more in a condition always to keep on foot an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my equally ſtrong, which might cover the Frontiers of the places they conquer'd, and they as well wanted Diſcipline as Money; ſo that the War was more like a tumultuous Robbing than a War ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd with prudence, or ſuſtained by the Forces of a well-order'd State, and by a diſciplin'd Army. The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with better order, and were provided with better means for keeping what they had, but yet they often wanted Money,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:110070:61"/>and <hi>Hungary</hi> ruin'd by both ſides, could not longer alone make their Armies ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. This was the reaſon that matters went on very ſlowly, and that they were not in the Field early enough, and late enough to oppoſe the Incurſions of the <hi>Male-contents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while the Towns on the Mountains openly favour'd <hi>Tekely,</hi> and had almoſt all been his, if he had known how to keep them. <hi>Alſol,</hi> which had ſubmitted to him, was no ſooner aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> put in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon which he was obliged to attacque. He carried it in few days by ſcaling the Walls, and ſoon after <hi>Newſole,</hi> which paſſes for the <hi>Capital</hi> of the Mountains, <hi>Chemnitz, Bolſenaw,</hi> and <hi>Libnia</hi> fell into his hands through the weakneſs of the <hi>Imperial Garriſons</hi> which were in them. The <hi>Emperors</hi> Army commanded by <hi>Count Wormb,</hi> not being in a condition to give Battel to <hi>Tekely,</hi> and the progreſs of the <hi>Male-contents</hi> frightning the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> they came again to a Treaty, which had no ſucceſs. <hi>Tekely</hi> and his Party were ſollicited to name what they deſired of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> with promiſe that whatever was equitable ſhould be granted them. Thereupon they anſwer'd very warmly, that they did not believe that any thing which they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:110070:61"/>would be refus'd, and if it ſhould be, they would give up to the <hi>Turks</hi> all the Towns which they had taken. They would have the <hi>Emperor</hi> expel from <hi>Hungary</hi> all the <hi>Church-men</hi> whom they ſhould name; that he ſhould grant them in due form an Amneſty for all that was paſs'd, that he ſhould give the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the free exerciſe of their Religion, that he ſhould reſtore to the poſſeſſion of their goods all them who had been diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, that he ſhould permit the <hi>Dyet</hi> to chuſe a <hi>Palatine</hi> of their Nation, and to ſet on foot again the firſt form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. In fine, that he ſhould give the <hi>Male-contents</hi> ſecurity for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Articles. No other anſwer was made by the <hi>Emperor</hi> to theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, than that they ſhould be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the <hi>Dyet</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and hanging this Treaty, ſo good a number of Troops was ſent to <hi>Count Wormb,</hi> that he reſolved to go to attacque <hi>Tekely</hi> and <hi>Boham.</hi> He found them near <hi>Alſol,</hi> and on their ſide prepared to fight. They fell to blows at break of day, and the Fight laſted till three hours after Noon. At that time the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> having receiv'd a Reinforcement, and the <hi>Male-contents</hi> beginning to give ground, <hi>Teckely</hi> and <hi>Boham</hi> caus'd a Retreat to be ſounded, and retired without diſorder under the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:110070:62"/>Cannon of <hi>Alſol.</hi> The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to intercept them by taking a ſhorter way croſs the Mountain, but that Paſs was ſo vigorouſly defended by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Cavalry which the <hi>Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> had placed there, that the <hi>Imperial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> retired with much loſs.</p>
                  <p>The next day <hi>Teckely</hi> having receiv'd a recruit of 1000 Men, marched again to oppoſe the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, and took the Corn almoſt in the view of the Town of <hi>Buſtroc,</hi> the Garriſon of which had made ſome diſcharges of Cannon upon his Avant Guard. After that, the ſeaſon being far advanc'd, he made a Truce for ſome months with the <hi>Imperial General,</hi> who was upon withdrawing within few days, and putting the Army again under <hi>Count Leſlie.</hi> Who came to it about the end of <hi>November,</hi> and having had ſome difference with <hi>Count Woarmb,</hi> he declared that he would not obſerve the Truce which that <hi>General</hi> had concluded with the <hi>Male-contents,</hi> but the preciſe Orders which came to him from <hi>Vienna,</hi> obliged him to keep it. The <hi>Imperial Court</hi> alſo thought it ſelf obliged to give <hi>Teckely</hi> leave to lodge his Troops in <hi>

                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:110070:62"/>and <hi>Boham</hi> took their Quarters at <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brezen, Weſſelini</hi> at <hi>Nagibania, Filek</hi> and <hi>Harak.

A little before the <hi>Princeſs Ragotski</hi> had endeavoured to corrupt <hi>Teckely,</hi> by offering him one of her Daughters in Marriage, and making him other conſiderable promiſes if he would quit the party of the <hi>Male-contents.</hi> He did not reject theſe Propoſals, which being diſcovered to ſome perſons, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuſpected by the other Leaders.

The <hi>Emperor</hi> who had been engaged in a War with <hi>France</hi> ever ſince the year 1673. and obliged to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy good part of his Troops for the defence of the <hi>Empire,</hi> being near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding a Peace with <hi>France,</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a condition to ſpeak more haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to the <hi>Male-contents;</hi> believing that he had put a diviſion among the <hi>Leaders,</hi> by rendring <hi>Teckely</hi> ſuſpected, and being able to diſpoſe of a greater number of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:110070:63"/>Troops, he demanded of the <hi>Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi> that before entring into a Treaty they would ſend home all the Auxiliary Forces which they had, and promiſed to have regard to their Complaints, but they took care not to fall into ſo groſs a ſnare.

                  <p>The Truce being ended there was no ſpeaking of either ſide of renewing it, and action began in the middle of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Tekeli</hi> who had ſpoken of an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation and who would have his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate reſtored, found himſelf but abuſed in theſe hopes. Theſe very goods which were worth more than two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, being in the hands of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were in credit at the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> hindred him from forſaking the party in which he had been engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is not the firſt time that they have rendred thoſe ſuſpected, whom they would have deſtroyed, by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they would reſtore what they had taken away. They had no deſign but to ruine for ever the <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who were concerned in the Revolt, and by no means to let them have wherewith to live in Peace. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keli</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:110070:63"/>did not fail to be revenged of this policy, and the <hi>Male-contents</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding how he was uſed confided in him more than ever. He ſeized on <hi>Chemnitz</hi> a Town on the Mountains which the <hi>Male-contents</hi> had had, and which they knew not how to keep: and made Incurſions which much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded the <hi>Imperialiſts.</hi> The ſame was done on all ſides, and the Army of the <hi>Male-contents</hi> although deprived of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> ſuccours was Maſter of the Field, by reaſon of the ſickneſs of <hi>Count Leſly</hi> and the weakneſs of the Imperial Army. The Plague which was in <hi>Hungary</hi> and in <hi>Auſtria</hi> abated the Efforts of both parties, and at the ſame time broke off ſome Treaties which had been begun; where the <hi>Emperor</hi> appear'd diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at laſt to yield to the <hi>Male-contents</hi> the greateſt part of their demands. This misfortune was herein advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that the <hi>Imperialists</hi> were in no condition to profit of their diviſions. <hi>Weſſelini</hi> the <hi>Palatines</hi> Son had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Army while <hi>Tekeli</hi> had been in <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and pretended to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it till the end of the Campagne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the arrival of the other, who came at the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of four thouſand men. <hi>Tekeli</hi> maintained that having been choſen

This difference ſo heated their Spirits, that the Army being divided between them came to blows; <hi>Tekeli</hi> had the advantage, and having taken his Competitor Priſoner, contented himſelf to ſend him to <hi>Clauſembourg</hi> in <hi>Tranſylvania.</hi> The Campagne ended without any thing conſiderable done, only that they agreed on a ſuſpenſion of Arms which was to continue till the end of <hi>April,</hi> in the enſuing Year.</p>

As ſome thought, theſe Remonſtrances hinder'd the <hi>Emperor</hi> from Executing the Deſign which he had form'd in the end, to grant the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> a Demand they had ſo long ſince made: But according to others, the appearance of a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to grant them being but a Feint, the <hi>Emperor</hi> himſelf caus'd this <hi>Deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from the Clergy of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to lay upon them the hatred which a too obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate refuſal, might draw upon the <hi>Court</hi> at <hi>Vienna;</hi> and that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> might believe, that of it ſelf it was not ill-diſpos'd towards them, ſince the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> did nothing of this, without firſt communicating it to his <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> Father <hi>Emerics,</hi> ſoon after Archbiſhop of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna;</hi> many people found it difficult to believe that this new Dignity had made him give his conſent to the treating the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> better.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Diet</hi> being open'd, the <hi>Emperor</hi> came to <hi>Bedembourg;</hi> and at laſt, after many difficulties, they were to come to the Election of a <hi>Palatine,</hi> and to reſtore the Government to its ancient Form. The <hi>Great Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Teutonick Order,</hi> who had been <hi>Viceroy,</hi> had done nothing but exaſperated their Spirits, and ſpoil'd
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:110070:67"/>all the Affairs; being neither a Man of the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> nor of the War. The <hi>Diet</hi> nam'd ſome Lords and preſented them to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> who choſe Count <hi>Paul Eſterhaſi;</hi> after which, he return'd to <hi>Newſtadt,</hi> when the new <hi>Palatine</hi> had taken the Oath of Allegiance to him.</p>
                  <p>The next day a Courier brought a Letter ſign'd by <hi>Tekeli</hi> and Six of the moſt conſiderable of the <hi>Malecontents;</hi> in which they declar'd, That they were ready to accept the <hi>Amneſty,</hi> Provided ſome Articles might be granted them; the greateſt part of which were the ſame which they had demanded before. There was One new one which was the Cauſe that this Letter had no Effect, which is, that they demanded a Sum of Money to be Paid the <hi>Turks</hi> which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd. This Letter being ſent the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi> he wholly rejected the laſt Article, and from that time Hoſtilities began again in the uſual manner by Incurſions. Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Diet</hi> propos'd to <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keli</hi> a countinuance of the Suſpenſion of Arms, which he promis'd to obſerve, provided, that Count <hi>Caprara</hi> obſerv'd it on his ſide, and that care were taken as ſoon as poſſibly to cover the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> from the vexatious Wars they had been expos'd to that time, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the free exerciſe of their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:110070:68"/>Religion. The <hi>Diet</hi> ſent Deputies to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> to repreſent to him the Neceſſity he was under to yield this Article; and farther, to pray him to turn out of Employment all them who had labour'd to have the Form of the Government of <hi>Hungary</hi> chang'd, and caus'd the Troubles by violating the Laws of the Realm. As theſe had done nothing but by Order of the Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and with its Approbation, this Demand appear'd too hardy: The <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> took time to anſwer it, nor would then conſent to grant freedom of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, although he before ſeem'd ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inclin'd to ſatisfie the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, that the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertis'd of the diſpoſition <hi>Tekeli</hi> was in to agree with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> ſent him a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who promis'd him the Principality of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> after the Death of <hi>Abaffi,</hi> and other Advantages to the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> if they would put what they held in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and what they ſhould take, under the Protection of the <hi>Port;</hi> and that they conſented and promis'd to Pay a Tribute of Eighty thouſand Crowns, provided it aſſiſted them with a Speedy and Powerful Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Diet,</hi> who fear'd as much as the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:110070:68"/>
                     <hi>Emperor,</hi> leſt the Turks who had newly made a Truce for Twenty Years with the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> ſhould enter <hi>Hungary</hi> with all their Forces; haſtened to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſomething which might ſatisfie the <hi>Malecontents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Endeavours at the ſame time were us'd to draw <hi>Tekeli</hi> to come to the <hi>Diet,</hi> by offering him the Sons of the <hi>Palatine</hi> as Hoſtages; but he abſolutely refus'd to go, fearing Treachery. In fine it was concluded, with the conſent of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi> that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould have thoſe Churches reſtor'd which they had built at their own Charges, but not the Churches which they had taken from the <hi>Catholicks;</hi> with liberty to build Three more new ones, and to have Preaching as before. They alſo enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Pay once for all a certain Sum to the <hi>Turks,</hi> in lieu of a yearly Tribute, upon condition that they lengthned out the Truce of the Year 1664. for Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years. In <hi>July,</hi> theſe Concluſions were communicated to <hi>Tekely,</hi> who kept firm to what he had demanded. He would have all places whatever where the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had had Preachings, to be abſolutely reſtor'd; and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Tribute ſhould be Paid which the <hi>Malecontents</hi> could not deny, becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> had their Wives and Children in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:110070:69"/>Hoſtage. Although this was no bad Reaſon, there was another not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which was yet more forcible.<note place="margin">The Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith.</note> Which is that after what had paſs'd, it was no more poſſible for the <hi>Malecontents</hi> to truſt to any Treaty, being ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the deſtroying them would never be ſcrupled when it could be done with ſecurity. Where Soveraign Princes think they have right to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all ſorts of Treaties with their Subjects, nothing but a Foreign Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that intereſted in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, can aſſure thoſe who have once taken Arms againſt them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Malecontents</hi> could not hope to be reſtor'd to their Countrey under the Government of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> but by rendring the Kingdom of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> Tributary to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who would find themſelves engaged to ſupport thoſe who had render'd them this important Service.</p>
                  <p>And from that time, the <hi>Turks</hi> began to make great Preparations, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ran, that they would go Succour <hi>Tekeli</hi> with 20000 Men, who joyn'd to the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvanians,</hi> might put them into a condition to Conquer all <hi>Hungary.</hi> This oblig'd Count <hi>Caprara</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:110070:69"/>to draw nearer to <hi>Tekeli,</hi> to obſerve his March, and hinder him from joyning the <hi>Turks.</hi> This report appear'd falſe, at leaſt for that Year, and all was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Incurſions and Pillages, like to thoſe of former Years. <hi>Tekeli</hi> took <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſermin, Little Waradin</hi> and <hi>Kalo;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Sack, than keep them.</p>
                  <p>Soon after <hi>Abaffi,</hi> who always had Pretenſions upon the County of <hi>Zath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> joyn'd <hi>Tekeli</hi> with an Army of <hi>Tranſylvanians,</hi> and with him undertook the Siege of <hi>Zathmar.</hi> Their Army being 30000 ſtrong, Count <hi>Caprara</hi> was in no Condition to attack them with his much Inferior in Number. All that he could do was to ſeize the Paſſes, to hinder the Enemies from proceeding to attack the Towns on the Mountains, or to caſt themſelves on any other ſide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Emperor's</hi> Lands. However <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keli</hi> nimbly paſs'd the <hi>Tibiſque</hi> with a Detachment of 5000 Men, while <hi>Abaffi</hi> continued the Siege. With this Body <hi>Tekeli</hi> exacted very great Contributions from divers places, for permitting the <hi>Hungarians</hi> to gather their Vintages. <hi>Abaffi</hi> in a little time makes himſelf Maſter of the Town; but having found more reſiſtance from the Cittadel than he expected, he at laſt rais'd the Siege, and contented himſelf with Pillaging ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:110070:70"/>Villages about <hi>Samos;</hi> ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that he had rais'd this Siege, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> had ſent him word that he intended that place as ſoon as they were Maſters of it ſhould be put into the hand of a <hi>Baſſa</hi> who aſſiſted <hi>Abaffi.</hi> Others ſaid, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a miſunderſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Tranſylvanians</hi> and <hi>Hungarians;</hi> and that this was the cauſe of raiſing the Siege. The worſt which hapned to them was, that ſome <hi>German</hi> Troops coming up to <hi>Abaffi</hi>'s Army, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no ſuch thing, put it into diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and took all their Booty.

                  <p>The Campagne ended as the precede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Years, with a Suſpenſion of Arms for ſome Months, and <hi>Tekeli</hi> was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put his Troops into Winter-Quarters within Four Counties on the other ſide of the <hi>Tibiſ<expan>

                  <p>In the mean while the Truce being ready to expire, it was agreed on both ſides that it ſhould be prolong'd till the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> yet they ceaſed not to make incurſions on both ſides. And the <hi>Malecontents</hi> ſeized the Corn which the <hi>Emperor</hi> had cauſed to be bought in <hi>Poland</hi> for the ſubſiſtance of the Army in <hi>Hungary.</hi> The <hi>Emperor</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived advice from <hi>Constantinople</hi> that the <hi>Turks</hi> gathered Troops together from all parts of their Empire, and that they were well diſpoſed in favour of <hi>Tekeli,</hi> who might be of great uſe to them for the conqueſt of <hi>Hungary;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at laſt to offer him all his Eſtate, and to ſuffer him to marry the Widdow of Prince <hi>Ragotski:</hi> But <hi>Tekely</hi> made a mock at this forced offer, believing himſelf in a condition to do what he deſired in a manner much more ſure by the help of the Turks.</p>
                  <p>He ſoon after came to <hi>Buda</hi> with a Body of Cavalry of three thouſand men,

                  <p>As ſoon as the Truce was expired a Body of <hi>Tartars</hi> whom the <hi>Turks</hi> had cauſed to come, made Incurſion as far as <hi>Trenſchin,</hi> and carried away a great number of People, which they carryed into the Lands of the <hi>Turks</hi> to ſell. <hi>Tekeli</hi> on his ſide with an Army made up of <hi>Male-contents</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> feigned as if he would march to <hi>Caſſovie,</hi> but coming on a ſudden before: <hi>Zathmar</hi> he ſurprized the Cittadel, and turned out the Garriſon, which conſiſted of but fourſcore men. From thence having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to Cannonade the Town he obliged it to ſurrender in few days. <hi>Count Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoldo</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Troops to relieve it as ſoon he had advice that the Cittadel had been ſurpriſed, but he could not come in time.

He took it the 14th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> after the Trenches had been opened three days, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd the Garriſon, which at firſt had anſwered fiercely enough, to ſurrender at diſcretion. <hi>Teckely</hi> gave it liberty to retire without Arms wither it would.

                     <hi>Male-contents</hi> joyned with a conſiderable Body of Turkiſh Troops commanded by the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi> marched together to <hi>Eperies,</hi> which yielded without reſiſtance, and was ſoon after demoliſhed that it might not be garriſoned. This Army takes alſo <hi>Leutch,</hi> the Fort of <hi>Zipt</hi> and <hi>Zendre,</hi> and enters into the County of <hi>Sapuſe,</hi> where it pillages and burns ſome other places. Soon after it divides, and <hi>Teckely,</hi> tho' ſick with a Tertian Ague, goes to ravage <hi>Sileſia</hi> while the <hi>Turks</hi> take <hi>Tokai.</hi> Altho' the <hi>Turks</hi> made open War with the <hi>Emperor</hi> under pretence that the <hi>Port</hi> had not declared, and had not ſent all their Forces into <hi>Hungary,</hi> the neighbouring <hi>Baſſaes,</hi> to whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was made of the Infractions, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtoutly that they had not in the leaſt broken the Truce in purſuing, as they ſaid, ſome Fugitives who daily pillaged their Lands, and in deſtroying the places to which they retired.

The news of the Siege of <hi>Filek</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried to the <hi>Imperial</hi> Commanders, <hi>Count Straſoldo</hi> marched on one ſide with 7000 Men, of which 3000 were Horſe, and 4000 Foot; <hi>Count Caprara</hi> on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide with 6000 Men, and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine Eſterhaſi</hi> with a Body of <hi>Hungarian Militia;</hi> but being come too late, they durſt not attacque the <hi>Turks,</hi> tho' infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in number.

Theſe ſo nimble ſucceſſes caus'd the <hi>Imperial Court</hi> to ſuſpect that the Commanders held correſpondence with the <hi>Male-contents.</hi> and <hi>Lamb</hi> was arreſted, being accus'd of having ill defended <hi>Caſſovie,</hi> and <hi>Straſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> for making a falſe report of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which he had found the Towns in <hi>Hungary.</hi> This is the cuſtom of Prit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whoſe Arms are unfortunate for want of their making the preparations neceſſary to carry on the War, to accuſe the Commanders of neglect of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or elſe of Treachery. <hi>Lamb</hi> died in Priſon before he had time to juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but <hi>Straſoldo</hi> eaſily made it appear that the account which he had given of the Towns of <hi>Hungary</hi> was very true, but that they had not ſent either the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:110070:74"/>Troops or Proviſions which he had judg'd neceſſary to keep them, tho' he had made many inſtances to have them. Then it was that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> thought it time to recompence <hi>Teckely</hi> for the ſervices he had daily rendred the <hi>Port,</hi> by declaring him <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary.</hi> To that end he ſent him a Veſt, a <hi>Cymeter</hi> and a Standard, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtom of the <hi>Port,</hi> with the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Patent. From that time <hi>Teckely</hi> coyn'd Money which was ſtampt on one ſide with theſe words,<note place="margin">Partium Regni.</note> 
                     <hi>Emeric</hi> Earl <hi>Teckely Prince and Lord of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates of the Kingdom of</hi> Hungary, and this on the reverſe; <hi>For God, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and Liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About that time the Campaign ended, excepting ſome few Incurſions by the <hi>Male-contents.</hi> Soon after a ſuſpenſion of Arms was agreed on, and during that time <hi>Teckely</hi> offer'd the <hi>Emperor</hi> the Towns of the Mountains, if he would pay him a certain ſum monthly, and at the ſame time threatned to burn them all if this offer were not accepted. The <hi>Emperor</hi> anſwered him, that to treat with his Soveraign he ought before all things to lay down his Arms; a condition too hard for the Head of a Party who had all ſorts of reaſons not in the leaſt to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:110070:75"/>truſt them againſt whom he had made War. Beſides, <hi>Teckely,</hi> who knew the deſign of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which was manifeſt ſoon after, made theſe offers only to amuſe the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and to make it believe that he would not make War otherwiſe than he had done the former years; that is to ſay, that he would aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don what he had taken, without putting himſelf to pain in keeping when an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould appear. Therefore he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little aſtoniſh'd at the haughty anſwer which had been made him, having on the other ſide reaſon to rejoice that the <hi>Emperor</hi> ſeem'd to fall into the ſnare.</p>
                  <p>But ſoon after it was underſtood at the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> that the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> came to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and that the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> was upon coming to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> which made the <hi>Emperor</hi> ſend <hi>Envoys</hi> to demand Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and to make an Allyance with <hi>Poland.</hi> Care was taken at the ſame time to exaggerate among the <hi>Hungarians</hi> who had ſubmitted to the <hi>Emperor</hi> the perfidy and impiety of the <hi>Male-contents,</hi> who would draw upon <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> all the Forces of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> They on their ſide accus'd the <hi>Imperial Council</hi> of an inexcuſable obſtinacy, ſince it would never do them juſtice, when it well knew that they would in the end
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:110070:75"/>be obliged to go ask it at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that the <hi>Turks</hi> once mov'd would not content themſelves to do what was deſir'd of them, but would pretend to be recompenced with new Conqueſts. In the mean while they made powerful preparations in <hi>Europe</hi> and in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and all the World preſag'd that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year they would enter into a cruel War. <hi>Teckely</hi> continued a long while ſick of a Tertian Ague at <hi>Mongats,</hi> where he had divers Conferences with one ſent Expreſs from the <hi>Emperor</hi> to endeavour to gain him, but as he had no greater ſecurity given him of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Promiſes made him than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and nothing elſe was demanded of him but to break entirely with the <hi>Port</hi> to deſtroy him in the end the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, nothing could be advanc'd on that ſide.</p>

At the beginning of the year 1683. the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> march'd their Troops towards their Frontiers as ſpeedily as was poſſible, but as on one ſide one ſaw the whole <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> in motion, and that the <hi>German</hi> Princes were not yet reſolv'd upon the Succours which they ſhould ſend into <hi>Hungary,</hi> there was reaſon to fear, not only for the reſt of the Realm, but alſo for the <hi>Hereditary Provinces.</hi> The <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:110070:76"/>Treaſury which was not leſs drain'd in Peace than in War, was leſs than ever in a condition to make an extraordinary Effort, and the Subjects of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who for a long time had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed more than they could afford in hope of ſeeing the exactions leſſened, would rather have furniſh'd Men than Money. Beſides, there was not ſeen in the preparations either the order or activity which had been neceſſary by reaſon of the multitude of Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries equal in Authority, and of their deſire to gain at the expence of their Maſter, to which deſire it was ſaid they were Subjects, becauſe they hop'd for no other recompence.</p>
                  <p>In the month of <hi>January Teckely</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Diet</hi> which he had ſummoned to <hi>Caſſovia</hi> about the end of the preceding year. There came the Deputies not only of the Towns of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which had ſubmitted to him, but alſo of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Counties which he threatned to pillage if they did not ſend. The <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> himſelf ſent <hi>Hoffman,</hi> Auditor of the Counſel of War, if it were poſſible to diſcover and break the deſigns of the <hi>Male-contents. Teckely</hi> ſaid in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, that there was no means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any Liberty to <hi>Hungary,</hi> but to ſtick to the Intereſt of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:110070:76"/>would reduce it to the ſame foot with <hi>Tranſylvania.</hi> He repreſented their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the deſign they had to carry on their Conqueſts ſo far, that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> ſhould be ſhut up between their Lands and <hi>Poland,</hi> ſo that it was time to declare for them, that by that means they might be the better us'd; that for himſelf he had done what he could to retard their Enterprize, but that he could not poſſibly. Nevertheleſs there were none but <hi>Male-contents</hi> who concluded openly to embrace the Party of the <hi>Port,</hi> others demanded time to conſider, and fail'd not to advertiſe the <hi>Emperor</hi> of what paſs'd. His <hi>Envoy</hi> alſo return'd without doing any thing, and it was in vain that it was propoſed at <hi>Vienna</hi> to a man whom <hi>Teckely</hi> had ſent to give his Maſter the Soveraignty of all the Lands which he had poſſeſſed in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary</hi> and ſome others. This man could not conclude on ſo great an affair, and the <hi>Turks</hi> were advanced too far to be likely to conſent to an accommodation of this nature. In the mean while <hi>Teckely,</hi> to ſhew that it was not through a ſpirit of revenge that he was engag'd in the War, ſent home without Ranſom a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of <hi>German</hi> Priſoners which he had taken the laſt Campaign. At the ſame time he guarded all the Paſſes of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:110070:77"/>the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts</hi> from furniſhing the places they yet had with Victuals and Ammunition.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> having come to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> about the end of the foregoing year, the Standard of the Horſes Tail was ſet up from the ſecond of <hi>January,</hi> and the Army began to draw to the ſide of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> where its Rendezvous was. The ways from <hi>Adrianople</hi> to that place were ſeen co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Troops which marched day and night. They who ſaw this March aſſure us, that to loſe no time, they caus'd a quantity of neceſſary proviſions to march by night by the light of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of large Lanthorns of white Linnen placed at convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and tied to the tops of Pikes. Although great preparations were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely made, both the Army and the Places thro' which it paſs'd ſuffered much from the Seaſon. The Peaſants were conſtrained to furniſh what they had of Forage and Victuals, if it could be found in their houſes, and if there was no body in them they were burnt. The Peaſants loſing leſs by theſe firings than if they had ſtaid in their houſes, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned a great many Villages to retire with what they could carry to the Woods and Mountains. Altho' what
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:110070:77"/>was poſſible was done in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to put it into a Condition to reſiſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Finances were either ſo ill admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd or ſo waſted, that the Soldiers not being paid, deſerted in great numbers, and often took part with the Army of the <hi>Malecontents.</hi> One party was plac'd in the Iſle of <hi>Schut,</hi> and the Inhabitants were ſo ill treated, that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to abandon their Houſes, and to retire where they could within the Neighbourhood. Theſe diſorders ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd thoſe very <hi>Hungarians</hi> who had kept within obedience, that if they had ſerv'd themſelves of this occaſion with readineſs and vigour, poſſibly they might have made all <hi>Hungary</hi> rebel. But in the courſe of theſe Wars, it has been a Thouſand times obſerv'd, that neither the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> have known how to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Faults of the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> nor the <hi>Malecontents</hi> of thoſe of the <hi>Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</hi> More Order, a little more Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and a little Skill in the Art Military, might have mutually ſerv'd and hurt both ſides: and if the one did not profit by the Advantages which they gain'd from time to time, the others had no better Conduct when they had the better.</p>
                  <p>In the Month of <hi>February,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> had a deſign upon the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Schut,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:110070:78"/>they hop'd to go over the Ice; but there being a Thaw the Enterprize fail'd and ſome Soldiers were drown'd. <hi>Tekeli</hi> endeavour'd alſo in vain ſome Weeks after to ſurprize <hi>Tirnaw,</hi> that he might hinder the Communication of <hi>Leopol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt,</hi> with <hi>Trentſhin.</hi> The <hi>Count</hi> Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd another <hi>Diet</hi> to <hi>Caſſeire,</hi> &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as he had before, to Pillage thoſe <hi>Hungarians</hi> who would not be there. He did not fail to execute his Menaces againſt them who refus'd to meet him, although the <hi>Emperor</hi> had forbidden them. While he was employ'd in theſe Military Executions, he receiv'd the News of having a Daughter born at <hi>Mongats,</hi> and he pray'd the <hi>Vaivode</hi> of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> to be <hi>Godfather;</hi> who ſent a Gentleman of the beſt Quality to ſtand for him.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Belgrade;</hi> and ſoon after about the ſame time, the <hi>Emperor</hi> had a Review of his Army near <hi>Presburg.</hi> It conſiſted of near 40000 Men, of which more than 12000 were Cavalry. But as he came not to Command, he ſoon after return'd to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and left the Command to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> That Prince after having long weigh'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould attack <hi>Gran</hi> or <hi>Newhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> determin'd upon the laſt, and went
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:110070:78"/>to form the Siege at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> when the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army march'd back again. Upon the advice which he had, he drew into the Iſle of <hi>Schut,</hi> to obſerve the Enemy from thence with greater Security, and to be in a condition to act on either ſide the <hi>Danube,</hi> as ſhould ſeem fitting. He went not far from thence, becauſe they could not yet judge with certainty of the deſign of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After having paſs'd the <hi>Save,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd near <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> and there it was that <hi>Tekeli</hi> came up to the <hi>Vizier,</hi> having croſs'd the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Valkowar.</hi> There were ſent to meet him 3 Leagues off before his coming up, the <hi>Chiaous Baſſa,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the <hi>Spahilar Aga,</hi> and divers other <hi>Aga's,</hi> to whom <hi>Mauro Cordato</hi> the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Chief Interpreter ſerv'd for <hi>Trucheman.</hi> Sixſcore of the <hi>Viziers Dellies</hi> came to offer him their Services, and told him, That they came to obey his Orders. They put themſelves at the Head the reſt of the March towards the Camp of the <hi>Turks</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After them march'd 150 <hi>Huſſars</hi> well mounted, with Trumpets and Kettle-Drums. One of them carried a Standard of a Blew Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, where one might ſee in Gold an Arm with a naked Sword in the hand, and the Name of <hi>Tekeli</hi> about it. There
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:110070:79"/>was alſo a Red Standard with his Arms, and ſome others with Six led Horſes. Fifty <hi>Hungarian</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Catholicks;</hi> and among others Count <hi>Humanai</hi> followed. One might ſee after that a Cornet who was follow'd with divers <hi>Hungarians</hi> mingled among <hi>Turks.</hi> Seven other Saddle-Horſes were led by Grooms cloath'd in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. One might ſee after them <hi>Tekeli</hi> himſelf upon an Horſe proudly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſs'd, which the <hi>Vizier</hi> had ſent him. There were about ſix Perſons with Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Skins upon their Backs, cloathed in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> faſhion, with a grey Cloath lin'd with white Wolves Skin, with edges of Silver upon the Hems, and long white Feathers in their Caps. There was alſo another Coach and two <hi>Calaſhes</hi> follow'd, with a Green Standard at the Head of a Company of <hi>Heydukes</hi> well appointed and arm'd. At laſt came a Troop of <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> who with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer made the number of 400. In this order <hi>Tekeli</hi> arriv'd at the Tent of the <hi>Vizier,</hi> who treated him and all his Followers with Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats.<note place="margin">Caftans.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vizier</hi> alſo preſented him with a Veſt lin'd with Ermine, and cover'd with a Stuff with ſmall Flowers of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon a red Ground; after which,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:110070:79"/>he was Conducted to a Tent which had been prepar'd for him, and which was encompaſs'd with divers others for the Nobility which he had with him. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keli</hi> had this Reception in the ſight of the <hi>Emperor's Envoy,</hi> that he might ſee the eſteem which they had at the <hi>Port</hi> for this Head of the <hi>Malecontents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tekeli</hi> had ſeveral Conferences with the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> upon the Deſigns which they might form in concert, and upon thoſe which each might execute by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; after which he return'd for <hi>Caſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi> As ſoon as he was arriv'd, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd a Manifeſto, by which he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the <hi>Hungarians</hi> who had any love for their Countrey to range themſelves under his Standards, and aſſur'd them, if they did, of the Protection of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> who had oblig'd himſelf to maintain them in their Eſtates, their Religion, and their Privileges. On the other ſide, he threatned thoſe who ſhould obſtinately adhere to the <hi>Emperor</hi> to Pillage their Lands, and give them no Quarter. As ſoon as this Manifeſto came into <hi>Lower Hungary, Papa, Thata, Weſtprin</hi> and <hi>Lewentz</hi> received thoſe that <hi>Tekeli</hi> ſent, theſe Towns being too much expos'd to the <hi>Turks,</hi> whoſe Army was too near for them to take long time to conſider what they had to do. The
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:110070:80"/>
                     <hi>Emperor</hi> fearing leſt all the Towns which he had in <hi>Hungary</hi> ſhould do the like, and turn out his Garriſons, gave Orders to the Governours to ſend out all the Ammunition, and to abandon them, that they might render themſelves at the Camp, which <hi>General Schultz</hi> had form'd near the <hi>Waag.</hi> This Order was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with much precipitation, and the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Catholicks</hi> withdrew at the ſame time, leſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themſelves upon them, for the ills they had ſuffer'd at their ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At the ſame time almoſt all the abandon'd places receiv'd <hi>Tekeli,</hi> and if he, or the <hi>Turks</hi> had been content with that Advantage that Campagne, and had only applied themſelves to fortifie the places as they might have been, and once for all to make themſelves Maſters of the Paſſes, poſſibly they might to this day have poſſeſs'd all <hi>Hungary.</hi> But we have often already remark'd, that the <hi>Malecontents</hi> were fit only to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the Turkiſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as ſome ſaid 200000 ſtrong, and according to others 120000 advanc'd towards <hi>Auſtria,</hi> without ſtaying to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack either <hi>Raab</hi> or <hi>Comorra,</hi> as it was thought it would have done. So that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had weakned
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:110070:80"/>his Army, that he might leave in thoſe places Garriſons able to employ the <hi>Turks,</hi> at leaſt ſome time, took care for no more than to place himſelf in ſome advantageous Poſt, to obſerve the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Forty thouſand Men which he had, were not able to diſpute the Field with ſo numerous an Army as that of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Therefore he poſted himſelf about the end of <hi>June,</hi> between <hi>Rabuits</hi> and <hi>Raab,</hi> and there expected the Enemies Army. On the Firſt of <hi>July,</hi> it appear'd on the other ſide of <hi>Raab,</hi> and the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts,</hi> that they might diſpute the Paſs, rais'd Batteries upon the River, which in ſome places incommoded the <hi>Turks.</hi> But they at the ſame time rais'd others, and detach'd a conſiderable Body of Cavalry to go ſearch an other Ford which was higher, and which <hi>Count Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diani</hi> defended with ſome <hi>Hungarians.</hi> Some <hi>Malecontents</hi> who led the Turkiſh Cavalry, no ſooner appear'd to <hi>Budiani,</hi> but he turn'd to their ſide, and ſuffer'd the Enemies Troops to paſs. They marchd directly to <hi>Rabuits,</hi> which they went through without oppoſition, and inſtead of applying themſelves to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> or to attack him on one ſide, while the Body of the Army came upon him on the other; they employ'd themſelves in Pillaging
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:110070:81"/>and making Slaves. The Paſſage over the River being thus gain'd, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> caus'd the Infantry in the Iſle of <hi>Schut</hi> to march, and kept the Cavalry with him, to obſerve the Enemy. A few days after, there was a Skirmiſh near <hi>Petronel,</hi> between that Cavalry and the Enemie's; which at firſt was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great Advantage on either ſide; although the Imperial Cavalry ſoon gave ground. In the mean while, ſince there was no probability of ſtopping the march of the Enemies, and that it was ſeen they intended for <hi>Vienna;</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> himſelf gave Order to Pillage all about, that the <hi>Turks</hi> might not find wherewith to ſubſiſt, and this Order was punctually executed, the <hi>German</hi> Troops being excellent at making waſte in a Country belonging to Friends as well as Enemies. The <hi>Emperor</hi> who ſtaid at <hi>Vienna</hi> till then, took no longer time to conſider on which ſide the <hi>Danube</hi> he ſhould retire, and a few days after he paſs'd over the Bridges of <hi>Vienna</hi> to get to <hi>Lintz</hi> by great Journeys, for fear of being Surrounded by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who ran on all parts. We are aſſur'd that there went out of <hi>Vienna</hi> more than 60000 Souls, who imitated the Prudence of the Court, and who did not think fit to be Buried under the Ruines of that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:110070:81"/>Town. On the 12th of <hi>July,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Burn the Suburbs, and to diſpoſe all things for a vigorous defence. It ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not been imagin'd that the <hi>Turks</hi> would leave behind them <hi>Comorra</hi> and <hi>Raab</hi> unattack'd, it was thought there was time enough to fortifie the place, if they ſhould carry the two others. So that there were only the old Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were not in a condition long to reſiſt ſo Puiſſant an Army; if the <hi>Turks</hi> had known what belong'd to attacking a place. Before they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted it, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> put in all the Foot which he could get together, which made about 17000, with a great Number of Gentry, who had thrown themſelves into the place, beſides the Burghers who were fit to bear Arms, <hi>Ernest Roger Count Staremberg,</hi> Great Maſter of the <hi>Ordonance,</hi> was declar'd Governor, and had given him ſeveral Generals who were to Command under him. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for all things, as much as the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time would permit, retir'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Bridges with the Horſe, having given Order to break them; ſo that it was ſuſpected that he was not ſure of undertaking the Defence as he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. On the 14th of <hi>July,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> encampt before the Town, and began
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:110070:82"/>to work on their Lines. The Town of <hi>Vienna</hi> being ſituated on the Southern Mouth of the <hi>Danube,</hi> which in that place makes two Iſles, croſs which Men paſs the River over three Bridges; The <hi>Vizier</hi> little skill'd in War, and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of good Counſel, did not at the firſt make any effort for rendring himſelf Maſter of theſe Bridges, which he might have done; but placed all his Army on the middle of the Town. He afterwards when it was too late repented of this Fault, when he had continued a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently long time before the place. The Works were not carried on with more Skill, the <hi>Turks</hi> having only ſome Runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades for Engineers, who ſeem'd able among People who underſtood nothing at all; but they are not comparable to the Chriſtian Engineers. Therefore they employed much time, and loſt abundance of People to gain the Works, which Chriſtian Troops could have gain'd ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, and without great loſs. On the other ſide, the Imperialiſts had a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Engineers, who if they were not well exercis'd, at leaſt were more than thoſe of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Brave and Able, perfectly well-employed their Men; who for the moſt part rather want Heads than Courage. I will not ſtay here to recount the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:110070:82"/>of the Siege, of which many Relations have been made; becauſe <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keli</hi> had no part in it.</p>
                  <p>While the <hi>Turks</hi> preſs'd <hi>Vienna,</hi> which they did at firſt with Vigour enough; he form'd a deſign of Beſieging with 20000 <hi>Hungarians</hi> and 8000 <hi>Turks,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Presburg,</hi> which held out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, although the Town had been Surrender'd. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Intelligence of it, ſent on that ſide 200 Foot, convoy'd with 300 Horſe, to endeavour to enter the Caſtle; but the Convoy was beaten, and the 200 Men obliged to return. Upon this News, he with ſpeed march'd his Cavalry, which conſiſted of 8000 <hi>Germans</hi> and 2000 <hi>Poles,</hi> Commanded by <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> and put 200 into the Caſtle. The Burghers ſurpriz'd to ſee an Imperial Army, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd almoſt as ſoon as they were Summon'd, and hardly gave the <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents</hi> time to retire to their Camp; which was not far from the Town. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keli</hi> incens'd at this Affront, which they had now done, ſent a Detachment of his Army to fall upon the Enemy, which at firſt made no movement, becauſe it was not yet rang'd in Battel. But as they ſoon as it was, who apparently had ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that they ſhould find no more than a Party of Imperial Horſe, believing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:110070:83"/>them ſufficiently employ'd in oppoſing the Incurſions of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to ſee the whole Army march towards them, and ſince theirs was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in number, they ſoon after thought of retiring. They did it in very good order; but being warmly charg'd by the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> they began to fly as faſt as they could, ſome to <hi>Tirnaw,</hi> and others to a River two Miles diſtant, on the other ſide of which they made a ſtand and ſtopt the Enemy, who did not think it worth their while to purſue them farther.</p>
                  <p>This Action was towards Evening, and in the Night <hi>Tekeli,</hi> who was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd at ſome diſtance from thence, thought that he ought to diſlodge againſt the opinion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd by themſelves near him; the Reaſon which he gave was, That it was of Importance to rally them who had newly been defeated, and dangerous to expoſe affrighted Troops to a Victorious Army. Thereupon the <hi>Turks</hi> divided from him, and would not rejoyn him but by expreſs Order from the <hi>Grand Vizier.</hi> This mixture of Chriſtian and Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Troops commanded by different Heads, produces no good. The Heads would often be of different Sentiments, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>uld one yield to the other, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:110070:83"/>the <hi>Turks</hi> would have the Chriſtians undergo all the hazard when there was any, as the Chriſtians ſought for nothing but advantaging themſelves at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Their Deſign had been to ſeize the Caſtle of <hi>Presburg,</hi> that they might have a Paſſage there over the <hi>Danube,</hi> that they might eaſily maintain a Communication with one another. For that end, the Turkiſh Cavalry which was not employ'd at the Siege, ought to have ſearch'd out that of the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and have conſtrained them to withdraw into <hi>Germany;</hi> which had not been diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for any other People beſides the <hi>Turks</hi> to have done.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> being drawn nearer to <hi>Vienna,</hi> that he might incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode the Beſiegers as much as he could poſſibly, the <hi>Malecontents</hi> provided for the <hi>Turks</hi> divers Boats, by means of which, they might have ſome Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with them, and at the ſame time might enter into <hi>Moravia,</hi> from whence they might draw conſiderable Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and part of which they might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage; nor could the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> be able to hinder them. Theſe laſt, in truth, march'd againſt the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> to take from them what they had gotten, and having come up to them, Charg'd them with vigour enough; but 300 Horſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:110070:84"/>who came to their Aſſiſtance, ſav'd the Booty which they had taken.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> took the way of <hi>Tuln</hi> and <hi>Krembs,</hi> to receive the Auxiliary Troops who came from all Parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> as faſt as they could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly. But having received advice that the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> followed by <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keli</hi> were entered into <hi>Moravia,</hi> they were oblig'd to turn on that ſide. In the end, the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> having known that the Succours advanc'd, and that the <hi>Imperial</hi> Horſe march'd to joyn them, gave Orders to the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Male-contents</hi> to make waſte in the Hereditary Countrey as far as they could, either to oblige the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to return that way, or to take from the Succours all means of ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when they ſhould arrive. From the 23d of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi> had enter'd <hi>Moravia,</hi> and had begun to make the Country in ſuch a manner deſolate, that it could not recover in a long time; for the <hi>Male-contents</hi> they were content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep encamp'd near <hi>Mark,</hi> and to promiſe the <hi>Tartars</hi> to follow them. In the mean while they did not advance at all, and it ſeem'd as if <hi>Tekeli</hi> as much fear'd the Succeſs of the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the Conſequences which the taking of that Place might have, as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear'd the Victories of the <hi>Emperor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:110070:84"/>
                  <p>In truth, were it ſuppoſed that the <hi>Turks</hi> had made themſelves Maſters of all <hi>Hungary,</hi> and of part of the Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Countries of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> they would have had no more need of <hi>Teckely,</hi> and perhaps might treat him with as much contempt as they had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid him honours while he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to them. On the other ſide, if the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould fail in the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> would be more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable than ever, becauſe ordinarily the <hi>Turks</hi> who are inſupportable with good Fortune, have little courage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bad. <hi>Teckely</hi> made theſe reflections, or had ſome other reaſon for acting leſs vigorouſly than ordinarily, and did not manage his Forces without cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having made Detatchment to diſcover the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the Enemy, followed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after with all his Horſe. The <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> come up, put themſelves into a poſture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and fell upon them ſo brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that at the firſt they routed ſome Squadrons, and ſome pierced even to the Body of Reſerve, but not being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſuſtained, the greateſt part of them who had advanced ſo far periſhed. After that the <hi>Tartars</hi> having in vain attempted to gain the Flank of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts,</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:110070:85"/>their Army divided into two parts, and one part retired towards <hi>Teckely</hi>'s Camp, the other towards the Bridges of <hi>Vienna,</hi> where a great many periſhed who caſt themſelves into the <hi>Danube,</hi> in hopes of ſwimming over.</p>
                  <p>The Infidels were inferior in number to the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> who had then above 30000 Horſe. There periſhed in that action between 1000 and 1200 Men of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> who had appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently been Conquerors if <hi>Teckely</hi> had aſſiſted them to purpoſe. The Turkiſh Troops, and thoſe of the <hi>Male-contents</hi> having been repulſed and beaten more than once on the other ſide the <hi>Danube,</hi> the <hi>Vizier</hi> could hardly have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with them, nor give them aſſiſtance, that there was one of the greateſt faults which he made in the Enterprize of the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> whereas he ought before all things to be Maſter of the two Mouths of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,</hi> and to purſue the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, which could not have made head againſt a much greater number of Troops; ſo that while one part of the Army had carried on the Siege, the other might have cover'd it, and have foraged all about which the <hi>Vizier</hi> having underſtood too late, order'd the <hi>Walachians</hi> and <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davians</hi> to labour to rebuild the Bridges
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:110070:85"/>of <hi>Vienna</hi> which the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and they began to do ſo, but the <hi>imperial</hi> Horſe being poſted on the other ſide with ſome Foot and Cannon, they could not bring it to paſs. In the mean while the King of <hi>Poland</hi> being-arrived with his Army by the way of <hi>Moravia,</hi> he left a Detachment with ſome <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> Troops to oppoſe the deſigns of the <hi>Male-contents</hi> while he paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> to joyn other Auxiliary Forces, and to attacque the <hi>Turks</hi> in concert with them. During the Siege <hi>Teckely</hi> having paſs'd the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Gran,</hi> went to ſalute the <hi>Vizier</hi> and having conferr'd with him, was ſent back again, leaving in the Camp only 1000 commanded by the <hi>Counts Nadaſti</hi> and <hi>Budiani.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Place was preſſed with vigour enough till the 11th of <hi>September,</hi> and had been reduc'd to extremity, when the Relief began to appear. We are aſſured that notwithſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and bravery of the beſieged, the <hi>Vizier</hi> had carried the Place before the Relief could be ready, if he had been lov'd by his Souldiers; but being greedy, and having undertook to furniſh the proviſions, he had done it with ſuch husbandry, that he drew upon him the hatred of all men; beſides that he was alſo hated by divers <hi>Baſſaes.</hi> Being but
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:110070:86"/>ittle skill'd in the Art Military, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he knew not how to preſs on the Siege, but he alſo committed two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital faults, beſides thoſe which we have taken notice of. He caus'd all about <hi>Vienna</hi> to be waſted by the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> inſtead of making all that he could find about it ſerve for the uſe of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a fault which made his Army ſuffer much at the end of the Siege. And yet farther, inſtead of ſecuring the Field on the ſide by which ſuccours might come, and when he had notice of their firſt approach, and he had not the precaution to ſeize the hollow ways and defiles thro' which they muſt needs come to him. After this ill Conduct he went out of his Lines to endeavour to beat back the Succours, the force of which he did not know, but having ſeen a formidable Army which amounted to more than 60000 Men compos'd of the beſt Troops of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> he thought of nothing but retreating, and abandoning his Baggage with all that was in his Camp; ſo that having on the 12th of <hi>September</hi> ſtop'd the Chriſtian Army for ſeven or eight hours by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the ground, and by a Skirmiſh of one part of his Troops who retreated inſenſibly, as ſoon as night was come he marched with diligence towards the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:110070:86"/>Paſſes of <hi>Rabuits</hi> and <hi>Raab,</hi> which he had caus'd to be guarded by <hi>Abaffi,</hi> that he might retreat on that ſide if he could not take <hi>Vienna.</hi> The day following he repaſs'd the <hi>Raab</hi> without being purſued by the Chriſtian Army, which being wearied with the great Marches it had made, was obliged to reſt ſome days. Thus it was that <hi>Vienna</hi> was delivered after a Siege of near two months, chiefly by the bravery of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who gave the chief Orders, and had the greateſt ſhare in the defeat of the Enemy. The ſecond being engaged to ſerve the Emperor to the utmoſt, was praiſed by all <hi>Europe</hi> for having done it ſo well, both during the whole Siege, and the day it was rais'd. The King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to whom the grandeur of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> might have given more umbrage than the Conqueſt of ſome Towns; for the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> acquired eternal Glory in deſpiſing the ſuggeſtions of a baſe Policy, and in leaving his Countrey to relieve a Town abandoned by its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Soveraign, when there was danger of arriving too late. If the <hi>Male-contents</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> had done as much for the <hi>Port,</hi> or rather for themſelves, their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs had not been in the declenſion as they have ſince been. But they ſeem
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:110070:87"/>born to have great occaſions and to loſe them; as their Enemies from that time ſeemed in poſſeſſion of braving the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Empire</hi> with Forces which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed a few years before, and which in truth they could not have equall'd if it had known how to ſerve it ſelf of them.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> reſolving to follow the <hi>Turks</hi> while they were under their fright, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the <hi>Saxon</hi> Troops had refuſed to go any farther, parted the eighteenth of the Month, and marched towards the Iſle of <hi>Schut,</hi> where they paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> ſeven or eight days after to go towards <hi>Lewentz</hi> and <hi>Buda,</hi> whither the Armies of the <hi>Male-contents</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, after having reinforced the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> and <hi>Gran.</hi> There the <hi>Vizier</hi> deſirous to caſt upon others the faults which he had committed, and vext at the defeat of his Enterprize, put to death the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> and ſome others, beſides ſeveral ſubaltern Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as not having well acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the Siege, and in the March to <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Seaſon being far advanced, and the Troops of <hi>Franconia</hi> and the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Foot being withdrawn ſome time after thoſe of <hi>Saxony,</hi> they were not in a condition to attempt any thing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:110070:87"/>conſiderable. The Garriſons of the Places belonging to the <hi>Turks,</hi> being, as has been ſaid, reinforc'd, the Armies of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Male-contents</hi> were not far from thence, and for all their loſs, much more ſtrong, being together, than the Chriſtian Army. In the mean while, that they might not have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in vain, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> reſolved to march towards <hi>Barkan,</hi> which is a Fort upon the Northern ſide of the <hi>Danube</hi> at the head of the Bridge of <hi>Gran.</hi> It was judg'd that if they could render themſelves Maſters of that Poſt, they ſhould be in a condition to undertake the Siege of <hi>Gran,</hi> if they thought fit, and might hinder the communication of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> with <hi>Buda.</hi> On the ſeventh of <hi>October</hi> the King of <hi>Poland</hi> having had falſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that the Detachment of <hi>Turks</hi> which was at <hi>Barkan,</hi> was not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable advanc'd with his Horſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expecting the coming up of the Foot contrary to the Opinion of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who fail'd not alſo to march immediately after him with the <hi>Imperial</hi> Horſe. The <hi>Poles</hi> at firſt drove back ſome Squadrons of <hi>Turks</hi> who appeared, bur thinking to give them the Chaſe, a great Body of Horſe came from behind an Hill, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:110070:88"/>charg'd them with ſo much impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that it made them to flie in their turn. The King ſuſtain'd his Men by other Squadrons, and himſelf advanc'd at their Head; but thoſe that fled, and the Shock of the <hi>Turks</hi> put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſorder, and they gave ground when the <hi>Imperial</hi> Horſe who had paſs'd a Defile on the left hand to come into the Plain where the Fight was, begun to put themſelves in order of Battle and to advance, ſo that it was ranged for falling upon the <hi>Turks</hi> in the Flank. The Infidels ſeeing new Troops come to them, and fearing to engage again, after making an halt, retreated inſenſibly and in good order, nor did the <hi>Imperial</hi> Cavalry purſue them.</p>
                  <p>The affrighted <hi>Poles</hi> had all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the World to be put again into order, and talkt of nothing but going into Winter-Quarters, without attempting any thing farther. The King, to diminiſh their fright, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to take the right hand, which was neareſt the Enemy, and marched his Troops to the left. They encamped in this order while they expected the Foot, to which Orders had been ſent to make haſte. They arrived the next day, and a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:110070:88"/>was taken to attacque the <hi>Turks</hi> the day following, being the 9th of <hi>October.</hi> The Chriſtian Army was about Thirty thouſand, two thirds of which was Cavalry, and the reſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry. For the <hi>Turks</hi> they were but Fourteen thouſand <hi>Spahies,</hi> and Twelve hundred <hi>Janizaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian Army advanced in the morning after having formed three Lines, the two firſt of which were of <hi>Imperial</hi> Troops, and the laſt of thoſe of <hi>Poland,</hi> one part of which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs was in the firſt Lines on the right and left, one commanded by the King, the other by General <hi>Jablanow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> appeared about Nine a Clock, rang'd in Battle as if they had been in a condition to reſiſt an Army twice as ſtrong as theirs, poſſibly not knowing the number of the Enemies, or puffed up with the advantage they had gain'd over the <hi>Poles</hi> two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Immediately they charg'd <hi>Jabla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowski,</hi> who was on the left Wing, thinking to rout the <hi>Poles</hi> in the firſt Engagement: But they being ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> turned all their Forces to that ſide, without minding the right, and the main Body which flank'd them, and with which they were within half an hour inclos'd
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:110070:89"/>and put to the rout. This is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Turks</hi> to act at firſt with an extream impetuoſity, without regarding danger, but when their Shock is over, and that they begin to be terrified, they run into diſorder, and nothing is able to put new Courage into them. As ſoon as they were once broken, they ran with all ſpeed to <hi>Barkan,</hi> and the firſt that came paſs'd the Bridge over the <hi>Danube</hi> with ſpeed, and broke it after them without ſtaving for the reſt of their Army. Soon after the Fort was attacqued on all ſides, and was entred with Sword in hand, the <hi>Turks</hi> who had not paſs'd over the Bridge madly threw themſelves into the <hi>Danube,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gain the other ſide either on Horſe-back or by ſwiming, inſtead of defending themſelves. As ſoon as it was underſtood that they might lodge all night at <hi>Barkan,</hi> both Poles and Germans were deſirous of it, and for fear they ſhould Quarrel <hi>Count Starem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> cauſed the Cermans to go out. The Poles having obſerved the Heads of ſome of their Companions, which the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſet upon the Paliſadoes, ſet fire to the Fort and burnt it down. We are aſſured that <hi>Tekely</hi> during the action was not far from thence, and that he drew near to joyn the <hi>Turks</hi> by
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:110070:89"/>the Viziers order; but having ſeen what had paſſed from the Neighbouring Mountains, he went back as faſt as he could. If this be true we muſt avow that this <hi>Count</hi> ill ferv'd them who had given him the Title of Prince of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi> In the mean while, if before he acted weakly for them for fear he ſhould make them too powerful, it was time to aſſiſt them with all his Forces, leſt he with them ſhould be driven out of <hi>Hungary.</hi> However it were whether through weakneſs or ill poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks the <hi>Malecontents</hi> did not do what they ſhould have done, on this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions.</p>
                  <p>After the taking the Fort of <hi>Barkan</hi> it was found that this Poſt being commanded by the Caſtle of <hi>Gran</hi> was of no uſe towards the Seige of that Town, and that there wanted time to put it into a condition of defence, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſadoes</hi> having been burnt. Therefore they abandoned it, and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> judged that it would not be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to paſs the <hi>Danube</hi> a little higher over againſt the two Iſles, which he deſigned to do an hours march above <hi>Gran.</hi> Order was given to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Comorra</hi> to ſend the Bridge of Boats which was before that place, to ſerve on this occaſion. The King of

                     <hi>Poland</hi> had been of a contray Opinion, but the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſo ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him, both the facility of the Enterprize, and the diſhonour it would be for the Chriſtians to end the Campaign, without having drawn any advantage from the conſternation which they had caſt among the Enemies by the Victories which they had newly gain'd, that the King at laſt conſented to ſtay and cover the Siege continuing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped on the ſide of <hi>Barkan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While they were at theſe terms <hi>Count Humanai</hi> comes with ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the <hi>Malecontents</hi> into the Camp of the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to entreat Audience of him. He grants it them, and after ſome Complements they tell him, they were very ſorry to ſee <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> covered with Trops of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> as it had been, and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries expoſed to the danger of falling under the Turkiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, but that they were not the cauſe, that all theſe misfortunes with all their Conſequences, ought to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to them who had adviſed the Emperor to violate all the Laws and all the Priviledges of <hi>Hungary;</hi> to have occaſion to pillage it without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the goods of thoſe who ſhould oppoſe them; while none were
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:110070:90"/>able to demand juſtice againſt them, that it ought not to be thought ſtrange that the Nobility and People of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> had deſired the Conſervation of their Priviledges with as much Ardour as ſtrangers had laboured to take them away. That it were unjuſt to exact from them, that they ſhould ſee all their Laws overturned, and their Goods and Families become a prey and ſport to the <hi>Germans</hi> without ſtirring. That they had a thouſand times carried their Complaints to His <hi>Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> that they always found him preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt them, by the great credit which they had who look on <hi>Hungary</hi> as an aſſured Pillage, if they could introduce an Arbitrary Government. That if not obtaining any ſatisfaction from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Council, ſome of the Nobility had taken unlawful ways to prevent the ruine of their Countrey, this fault would be at leaſt as pardonable as the Pillages and Violences of ſtrangers: That alſo the greateſt part did not at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enter into any Conſpiracy, but that the Enemies of the Realm had with joy taken advantage of the faults of ſome few, that they might treat as Rebels all who had any thing to loſe, and ſeize on their goods; this ſtrange co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:110070:91"/>part from them. That as to be accuſed and have an Eſtate, was the ſame thing as to be Condemned to Death, or at leaſt to loſe all that one had: Deſpair had put in Arms the People who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nothing but to live in Peace, obeying the <hi>Emperor</hi> and the Laws, that in purſuance thereof the <hi>Emperors</hi> evil Counſellors had carried him to change the whole form of the Government without having any regard to Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, of which they who remained within Obedience ought not to have been deſpoiled by reaſon of <hi>Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</hi> That in truth he had reaſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ancient Government but as to the reſt the Laws had no more Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than before, and the Realm was dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a prey to ſtrangers. That the <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents</hi> had not ceaſed to offer his <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Majeſty</hi> to lay down Arms, if he would re-eſtabliſh the Laws, and would give any ſecurity that they ſhould not be uſed as formerly. That they came ſtill with the ſame intention, and that they pray'd his Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceed for them, not doubting but he was touch'd with the miſeries of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary;</hi> and for ſo many years to ſee blood-ſpilt which might be better employed The King of <hi>Poland</hi> teſtified to them a ſenſible concernment at what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:110070:91"/>and expreſſed a great deſire of ſeeing their miſeries at an end. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved at the ſame time that he was bound to procure them Audience of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who refuſed to hear them without the Emperors leave, but at laſt thought fit to comply with the King of <hi>Poland.</hi> The Deputies of the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> after having proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that whatever opinion might be conceived of their conduct, againſt which they would have it that an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of People were prejudiced without having well examined it, they had always been for Peace and did not yet demand any thing elſe: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented that they were ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Treaty with Commiſſioners; that his <hi>Imperial Majeſty</hi> ſhould give them that, for that end it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as it had been at the end of former Campaigns to make a ſuſpenſion of Arms, and to mark the Counties of <hi>Hungary</hi> where it ſhould be found fit for the Troops of the <hi>Malecontents</hi> to take their Winter Quarters. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had no Orders, thereupon repreſented to them the wrong which they had done in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in Rebellion, and exhorted them to renounce all manner of Alliance with the <hi>Turks</hi> to lay down their Arms and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:110070:92"/>implore the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Clemency; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, he doubted not but they would have cauſe to praiſe his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Deputies replied, That if they had taken Arms, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into any Engagement with the <hi>Turks,</hi> it was but by force, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen that their Enemies hinder'd the <hi>Emperor</hi> from having any regard to their juſt Complaints; and that there was no appearance that he would do them Juſtice. Thereupon they went back to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> where they ſtay'd ſome time; and by that it was perceiv'd, that they were not in ſuch a terrour as was thought.</p>
                  <p>Soon after <hi>Lewentz</hi> opened its Gates to the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>Tirnaw, Trenſhin,</hi> and <hi>Nitrie,</hi> who had taken part with the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> at the arrival of the Turkiſh Army, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd againſt them after the Battel at <hi>Barkan.</hi> As ſoon as the Bridge which the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> caus'd to be made was finiſh'd, and that his Troops had paſs'd to the other ſide, the County of <hi>Weſprin</hi> followed the example of the others. On the 23d of <hi>October,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> encamp'd at <hi>Gran,</hi> upon the Avenues of <hi>Buda,</hi> to hinder them from relieving the place on that ſide. He had been reinforced with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:110070:92"/>the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Foot, which he ſent the <hi>Emperor;</hi> from which Men were aſſur'd that this was to cloſe the Campagne with an Enterprize which might bring Honour to the <hi>Imperial</hi> Arms. He alſo came himſelf to the Camp with what Horſe he had on the 26th in the Morning, and ſaw the Reduction of the Place the day after. The Garriſon near 4000 Strong, went out the 28th with Arms and Baggage according to the Capitulation, and was Conducted to <hi>Buda.</hi> Although the Fortifications of <hi>Gran</hi> were not conſiderable; yet a Garriſon ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous might eaſily have defended it a long while, if the Loſſes which the <hi>Turks</hi> had this Campagne had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated them. Beſides the Caſtle which is upon a Rock, and which has a Spring of Running Water, which alone might ſupply them ſome Weeks, if a diſorder had not been among the Infidels. The <hi>Viſier,</hi> who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of War, ought to have Cover'd <hi>Gran,</hi> and who had nothing to fear, being ſtill much more ſtrong than the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> retir'd not only to <hi>Buda,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Belgrade;</hi> where he was Strangled for his Ill Conduct, the 25th of <hi>December</hi> the ſame Year,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:110070:93"/>by Order of the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> gave the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Gran</hi> to <hi>Carlowits,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of the Regiment of <hi>Count Marc Staremberg,</hi> with a Garriſon of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, and repaſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> to the Army on the 30th, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given the Neceſſary Orders for repairing the Breaches of the Place. They ſpoke of nothing after that but Winter Quarters, and there were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Counties of <hi>Eperies, Caſſovia,</hi> and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kai,</hi> which the <hi>Malecontents</hi> had the preceding Winter with the Frontiers of <hi>Tranſylvania.</hi> As to the laſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, the King agreed with the <hi>Vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide</hi> for Money, that he might not be burthenſome to the <hi>Tranſylvanians</hi> and obtain'd of the <hi>Emperor</hi> a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger extent, for his Quarters in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before his parting to go thither, the King gave the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to underſtand, that he would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him in hearing once more the Propoſals of the <hi>Malecontents.</hi> The Duke excus'd himſelf at firſt, for that he had not yet received from the <hi>Emperor</hi> any Power to treat of this Affair; but the King repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, that without engaging
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:110070:93"/>himſelf to any thing, he might hear what they ask'd, and take ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereupon as he ſhould judge fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he conſented. For that end, a Meeting was had in the King's Tent the Fifth of <hi>November.</hi> The Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who had been inſtructed by the Deputies of the <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,</hi> was their Spokeſman. He in few words made appear the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the <hi>Emperor</hi> might draw from <hi>Hungary,</hi> by granting what they askt, in the War againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> in which, being joyn'd with his Army, they might eaſily reſiſt the Infidels without neceſſity of ſeeking help elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. He ſhew'd that His <hi>Imperial</hi> Majeſty, who values himſelf upon his Clemency more than any other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, would do a good thing in giving Peace to an infinite number of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, who would ſuffer more than could be imagin'd in a Civil and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign War. After that, he propos'd Six Articles on the part of the <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,</hi> which he deſir'd to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Cenſervation of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges.</item>
                     <item>2. Liberty of Conſcience.</item>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:110070:94"/>
                     <item>3. The Reſtitution of Confiſcated Eſtates.</item>
                     <item>4. The Summoning a Free <hi>Diet,</hi> and wherein they could to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</item>
                     <item>5. Winter Quarters and a Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Arms while they were upon a Treaty.</item>
                     <item>6. The Soveraignty of ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which had the Year before been offer'd to <hi>Tekeli.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The <hi>Vicechancellor</hi> of <hi>Polund</hi> added to this, That although they had had great Advantages againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> they muſt not imagine that they had entirely quell'd them; That by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Malecontents</hi> deſperate, they would joyn them with the <hi>Turks</hi> for ever; and that it was impoſſible to be aſſor'd that this Conjuncture would not ſometime yet produce great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> anſwer'd, That they might expect all from the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of His Imperial Majeſty, if they would immediately break with the <hi>Turks</hi> and ſubmit themſelves to the diſcretion of their Soveraign. That this was all the Counſel that he could give, and that he had no other
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:110070:94"/>Anſwer to make to their Propoſitions. Thereupon they ſeparated, and the Deputies return'd to the place from whence they came.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to put the Imperial Troops into the Quarters which had been aſſign'd them, and left the <hi>Counts Rabata</hi> and <hi>Caraffa,</hi> with <hi>Baron Merci,</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them. All the Neceſſary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being given, he took the way of <hi>Lintz,</hi> where the <hi>Emperor</hi> ſtill was. The King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who had parted ſome time before for <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> took in his way the Small Town of <hi>Schim,</hi> where was a Turkiſh Garriſon. He continued on his March, and ſent to Summon <hi>Caſſovia;</hi> which having a ſtrong Garriſon of <hi>Malecontents,</hi> refus'd to Surrender. The King not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to force them in the middle of the Winter, and not liking to leave his Troops expos'd to the Incurſions of the <hi>Malecontents</hi> in a Country of which they had no knowledge; made but little ſtay in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary.</hi> He gave Order to his Army, excepting ſome Foot to enter into <hi>Poland,</hi> and took the Paſſes to return to <hi>Cracovia.</hi> His Army followed him ſoon after, and left the <hi>Germans</hi> the liberty to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:110070:95"/>take the Quarters which had been aſſign'd them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cara Muſtapha</hi> had preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> the firſt time at <hi>Belgrade;</hi> and to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had laid the blame upon ſeveral others, and particularly upon <hi>Tekeli,</hi> by whom he ſaid he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd. The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſatisfied with his Reaſons; but whether it were that as ſoon as he came to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> whither he went ſoon after, ſome had taken Care in his Preſence to aggravate the Faults of the <hi>Vizier,</hi> or upon any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, he, as has been ſaid, ſent to have him Strangled. In the mean while <hi>Tekeli</hi> having notice of the ill Impreſſions the <hi>Vizier</hi> had given of him to his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſubſiſt without Aid of the <hi>Port,</hi> took a Bold Reſolution, which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded well. He render'd himſelf at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and having obtain'd Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> he told him, That being inform'd that his Conduct had been miſ-repreſented to his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> he came to juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before him, or to offer him his Head, if he were culpable. The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> was touch'd at his Submiſſion,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:110070:95"/>and the Confidence which he appear'd to have in the Juſtice of the <hi>Muſulmans.</hi> He gave him <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> to whom <hi>Tekeli</hi> related the particulars of the <hi>Vizier</hi>'s Faults, of which he had been already inform'd in part. Among theſe Faults, he particularly enlarg'd upon one of them, on which we have remark'd above; which is, That the <hi>Vizier</hi> not having given him Troops enough to act on the other ſide the <hi>Danube,</hi> the Imperial Horſe, which were the beſt Horſe in the World, had been in a condition to traverſe his Deſigns; and that it had been ſtrong enough to be Maſter of the greater part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> almoſt in the View of ſo formidable a Body. Beſides, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to have Communication rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and eaſie enough with the <hi>Vizier,</hi> who was not Maſter of the <hi>Danube,</hi> he could not be reliev'd when he needed it, nor could give the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Advices; That if the <hi>Vizier</hi> had had the Precaution to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of ſome Paſs upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> though he had not ſucceeded before <hi>Vienna,</hi> he might have preſerv'd to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> all the <hi>Upper Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> which held with the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> by retreating on that ſide; That his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:110070:96"/>Army joyn'd to that of the <hi>Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> was yet ſtronger than was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to beat the Army of the <hi>Emperor</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> in caſe they durſt have purſued the <hi>Vizier;</hi> and that it had been eaſie to take Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in thoſe Parts of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had never been, but becauſe they had abandon'd them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reaſons ſupported by the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier</hi>'s Enemies, and conformable to the Prejudices they had given the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> againſt the Conduct of that <hi>Miniſter,</hi> appear'd to him ſo plauſible, that he promis'd <hi>Tekeli</hi> his Protection, and gave him his word, that he would never forſake him. The <hi>Count</hi> for his part fail'd not to give hope, that with the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Port,</hi> he would reſtore Matters into ſo good a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he ſhould give the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> more trouble than ever. The <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> after having caus'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Muſtapha</hi> to be put to Death, nam'd in his Place <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who before had been <hi>Caimacan.</hi> This new <hi>Vizier</hi> after he had a long time conſulted with the other Miniſters of the <hi>Port,</hi> was of Opinion to make Peace with the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror;</hi> but the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> as they aſſure us, was ſo oppoſite to this,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:110070:96"/>whether becauſe of his word paſs'd to <hi>Tekeli,</hi> or for any other Reaſon, that he followed the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which was for his continuing the War.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110070:99"/>Obedience: It was high-time to act even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to exerciſe a ſevere Diſcipline in the Army, in order to frame a Body, whereof all the Members were to conquer or periſh together. <hi>Teckely</hi> had a mind, in conſequence of this Reſolution, to go and force <hi>Baragozzi</hi> in his Caſtle; but the Count of <hi>Rabata</hi> being come to his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he turned his Arms againſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>war,</hi> which ſurrendred at Diſcretion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three days Reſiſtance. <hi>Humanai,</hi> who was within it, was brought to <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> where he loſt his Head.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Severities ſtop'd the Courſe of the Deſertions, as well as two conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Omiſſions in the General Pardon; whereof one was Liberty of Conſcience, and the other, the Security of Privileges. Theſe two Articles being the only Cauſe of the War, thoſe who loved the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their Country, more than their Eaſe, could not induce themſelves to lay down their Arms, without obtaining what they demanded thereupon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Teckely</hi> being unable to procure a Truce for this Winter, made the Imperialiſts repent of it, by the perpetual Incurſions and Undertakings he made againſt them. He attacked <hi>Michelsdorf,</hi> where the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had left three hundred <hi>Lithua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in Winter-quarters. He made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of it, killed part of theſe <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuanians,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:110070:99"/>and made the reſt Priſoners of War. The Troops of <hi>Poland,</hi> who had made great Marches to come into <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſeeing that inſtead of repoſing themſelves during Winter, it was neceſſary to be engaging with the Male-contents at all moments, and to be ſatisfied with a very ſmall matter, by reaſon of the Indigence which reigned in the Places where they were; theſe Troops, I ſay, deſerted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, which obliged the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to recal them. Beſides, this Prince had no Intereſt in exterminating entirely the Male-contents, to render the Emperor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter in <hi>Hungary,</hi> without any one's, but the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Advantage by it. Theſe Troops were no ſooner withdrawn, but <hi>Teckely</hi> ſeized upon their Quarters, and fixed there a Party of his own.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> on their ſide, acted with more Vigor than was imagined, and for all they had been repulſed in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they did not fail to beſiege and take, in the Month of <hi>March, Leutſch,</hi> wherein was the Regiment of <hi>Grana,</hi> and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe of <hi>Caraffa</hi>'s. This General, having been too remiſs in haſtning to the Succour of this Place, received Advice of its being carried, as he was marching on that ſide with ſome Troops. <hi>Debrezen,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> had vainly attempted to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110070:100"/>win ſome time before, now underwent the ſame deſtiny. <hi>Teckely,</hi> in the mean time, got all that is about the Cities of the Mountains, and made Contributions be paid to him in all Places that he could not conveniently hold. In theſe Movements, the Imperialiſts, commanded by Colonel <hi>Heuſter,</hi> defeated alſo a Detachment of five hundred of his Men, whom he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as a Conduct of <hi>Petrozzi;</hi> altho the Advantage was generally on the ſide of the Male-contents.</p>
                  <p>Judging themſelves now to be in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of obtaining ſomething with the Emperor, they ſent to entreat the King of <hi>Poland</hi> again to intervene in this Affair, and conſented, if he thought fit, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg him for Mediator. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> having received them favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enough, offered his Mediation to the Emperor to reconcile, if it was poſſible, his Subjects with him: But the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which thought to be ſoon prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to expel for-ever the Male-contents from <hi>Hungary,</hi> and to eſtabliſh a Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Power there, would hearken to no ſort of Compoſition. There-upon the King declared, That for the future he would not permit his Troops to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt the Male-contents, altho he offered them ſtill to ſerve againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> This Declaration did not diſpleaſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110070:100"/>the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who look'd upon it as a thing of ill Preſage to them, that <hi>Hungary</hi> ſhould become Hereditory, and that it ſhould be no longer permitted to talk of Laws and Privileges there. It is known that the Grandees of this Kingdom are very jealous of their Liberties, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the Right they have to chooſe their Kings; and in this Diſpoſition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they had done better to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely to the Malecontents, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to oblige the Emperor to grant them Peace, and to render themſelves Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Treaty, than to aſſiſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to make himſelf abſolute.</p>
                  <p>About this time an Artifice was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed more than ever in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which has ſucceeded many times to deſtroy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties compoſed of Perſons of different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions. To diſingage the Catholicks from the Proteſtants, the Imperialiſts ſaid every where, that it was nothing but a War of Religion that was made; and that if the Catholicks, who had no occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Liberty of Conſcience, ſubmitted themſelves to the Emperor, they would obtain whatſoever they deſired. Under a Pretext that <hi>Teckely</hi> had put to death the Count <hi>Humanai,</hi> and ſome Catholick Lords, they endeavoured to perſwade thoſe of this Religion, that the Head of the Malecontents did labour inſenſibly to

Theſe Diſcourſes, wherein was obſerved ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of appearance, were capable of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a world of Perſons, if ſo be they had not been oppoſed by ſome Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Luſtre, and which was generally diſperſed. 'Tis this engaged <hi>Teckely</hi> to write a Letter to his Holineſs, dated the 12th of <hi>April,</hi> whoſe Contents are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid that in the Year 1683, he had declared to <hi>Saponara,</hi> Envoy to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty, that he was ready to put an end, as far as his Power extended, to the Civil War of <hi>Hungary,</hi> if he might obtain certain Conditions which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, provided that the King and States of <hi>Poland</hi> were Guarantees of the Treaty; That finding himſelf abſolutely denied, he had been obliged to tie himſelf more ſtrongly than before to the Intereſts of the Port; That he had entred into this Engagement, not that he had not as much Zeal as any one for the Chriſtian Religion, but becauſe he ſaw moſt clearly, that the Emperonr excluding the <hi>Hungarians</hi> from the Defence of their Country, he could not poſſibly be in a State of oppoſing the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Puiſſance: That he could not reaſonably be treated as a Rebel, ſince he had not taken up Arms to deprive the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110070:104"/>King of <hi>Hungary</hi> of his due, but only to preſerve to his Country thoſe Privileges which had been allowed it before the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had a foot therein. That his Holineſs might conſult thereupon the Letters of King <hi>Andrew</hi> II, which were in the Records of the <hi>Vatican:</hi> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to take up Arms he had ſeen his Eſtate confiſcated and pillaged, as well as an infinite number of Catholick Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to whom was appointed incompetent Judges to condemn them to Death or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, without having any regard to the uſual Formalities of Juſtice: That <hi>George Leppaz,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> had uſed the ſame Inſtances with them, for the Obſervation of thoſe Privileges which the Emperor had ſolemnly ſworn to keep firm at his coming to the Crown. That all theſe Complaints had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, and were rejected with Diſdain by the German Counſellors of his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſty: But as for him he had never inclined towards the Deſtruction of the Catholick Religion in <hi>Hungary,</hi> nor would. In a word, that he aimed at nothing elſe, in reſpect of Religion, but to preſerve the Freedom granted by the Laws and Diets before the Reign of <hi>Leopold</hi> to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of <hi>Hungary,</hi> without deſigning to touch upon the Rights of the Catholicks.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:110070:105"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> advanced in the beginning of <hi>June</hi> new Troops towards <hi>Buda,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Kara Huſſan Oglon,</hi> who had been made Grand Vizier, but having marched too ſlowly, the duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> prevented him. About the 16th of the Month he went to attack <hi>Vicegrad,</hi> which is below the <hi>Gran,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Turks</hi> from relieving <hi>Neuhauzel</hi> by removing farther off their Frontiers on this ſide. He won the City the very Evening of the Day he arrived there, and the Caſtle ſurrendred the next day after, having made an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Defenſive Reſolution. In the mean time a Detachment of <hi>Turks</hi> fell upon the Baggage which had been left near <hi>Strigonium,</hi> in order to march with more Expedition, but they were repulſed, and the Imperial Army, which was before <hi>Vicegrad,</hi> had nothing but the fear of having loſt it. The Caſtle was found to be abſolutely unprovided of Ammunition and Proviſion, which had proceeded from the Confuſion which the Death of the Vizier had introduced into Affairs. There was alſo a Battel near <hi>Weitzen</hi> about the end of the Month, between the Imperial Army, which had repaſſed to the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and a conſiderable Body of <hi>Turks,</hi> who were defeated, and conſtrained to retire to <hi>Buda</hi> in Confuſion after a loſs of five or ſix hundred Men.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110070:105"/>After that <hi>Weitzen,</hi> a ſmall Place which is upon the Northern Arm of the <hi>Danube,</hi> in that place where it forms the Iſle of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> was attack'd ſo unexpectedly, that five hundred <hi>Turks</hi> who were therein ſurrended at Diſcretion. From thence they marched ſtraight on to <hi>Peſt,</hi> which the Gariſon abandoned after having ſet fire to it, and ruined the Fortifications. The Gariſon retired to <hi>Buda,</hi> and as ſoon as the Army appeared, ſome <hi>Janizaries</hi> that were left to guard the Bridg of Boats which were there, broke it down before they could obſtruct them. They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to extinguiſh the Conflagration of <hi>Peſt,</hi> and left ſome Troops there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Fortifications that remained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Poſt might be of advantage in caſe there was any thought of undertaking the Siege of <hi>Buda.</hi> But thoſe who had been left there were ſo incommoded ſome days following by the Cannon of <hi>Buda,</hi> that it was neceſſary to withdraw them from thence. After that they made a Bridge of Boats over againſt the Iſle of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> over which the Army having paſſed upon the 10th of <hi>July,</hi> it gained a conſiderable Advantage upon ſome Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Troops who came to engage it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing the whole Imperial Army was there.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:110070:106"/>
                  <p>Four days after it marched-to <hi>Buda,</hi> a famous City, in that it has been the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ancient Kings of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and for two or three Sieges it had ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Chriſtians without being taken, ſince <hi>Solyman</hi> became Maſter of it in 1541. It was notwithſtanding but ill fortified, being flanked with none but old Towers without any Baſtions, in ſo much that nothing but a powerful Gariſon could render the taking difficult to a General pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Conveniencies, and dexterous in the Art of beſieging Towns. It was at that time filled with all ſorts of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and defended by a Gariſon of eight thouſand Men commanded by five Baſſas. Nevertheleſs they did not think it proper to perſevere in holding the lower Town, which they ſet on fire as ſoon as they were beſieged, in order to retire into the upper one, which is ſupported by a good Caſtle, and is much more eaſy to defend. During the firſt days of this Siege, the Imperialiſts got three conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Advantages upon the Turks. The <hi>Croats</hi> defeated fifteen hundred Men near <hi>Wirowitza,</hi> and four hundred as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from this Defeat; and the greateſt part of the Imperial Army being gone out of its Lines, beat, a few days after, a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Army of twenty thouſand Men, who were encamped ſome Leagues from <hi>Buda</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:110070:106"/>in order to relieve the Place if it was poſſible, or to incommode the Imperialiſts during the Siege, and to cover the reſt of <hi>Hungary.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> at the ſame time ſuſtained great Loſſes in <hi>Croatia,</hi> and the Malecontents were diſadvantag'd in divers places.</p>
                  <p>But as the Imperialiſts could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer in ſo many parts, nor beſiege ſeveral places long without loſing a world of Men, the Army which beſieged <hi>Buda</hi> could receive no conſiderable Succour from the reſt, and without Succour it durſt not attempt a general Aſſault, altho it was poſſeſſed of almoſt all the Outworks of the Place. This Army had already loſt in the beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> near eight thouſand Men, either in Battels, or in the Siege, or elſe by Sickneſs. It had not Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition enough, nor Proviſion, nor Fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Kara Mehemet</hi> Baſſa of <hi>Buda,</hi> was one of the beſt Officers of the Turkiſh Empire, and made all poſſible Reſiſtance. The whole Gariſon was likewiſe fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on defending the Place to extremity, and fatigued the Imperial Army by vigorous Sallies. Altho there were conſiderable Breaches made, the Turks were intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and palliſado'd behind, becauſe the Imperialiſts were not in a condition to take the advantage of it quick enough. Notwithſtanding <hi>Kara Mehemet</hi> was killed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110070:107"/>with a Cannon Bullet, which took off his Thigh, the reſt did not loſe their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thereupon, in hopes of being ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relieved by the Seraſquier, who marched in the place of the Viſier. The Beſiegers loſt every moment Perſons of note, and ſeveral of the chief Officers were ſick or wounded. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was taken with a Feaver, and the Count of <hi>Rabata</hi> was commanded to come and aſſiſt him in the Functions of General, which he could not diſcharge with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Exactneſs, by reaſon of his Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>The Imperial Army being in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> arrived with his Troops the ninth of <hi>September;</hi> and his Arrival was extreamly neceſſary to revive the Hearts of the Souldiers. He gave Directions for the raiſing of new Batteries, and diſpoſed all things for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Aſſaults: but it is ſaid, that they employed not in this Siege all the Art that is neceſſary in theſe Encounters, and which is of more Service than the number of Souldiers, and all imaginable Vigour. The Bombs and Careaſſes were not in ſufficient quantity, nor the Artillery well enough prepared. The Ingineers in too ſmall number, and perhaps as little experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as they were rarely paid, were but a moderate Aſſiſtance. They were almoſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110070:107"/>conſtrained to win the Place, if one may ſay ſo, by force of Arms, in which the <hi>Turks</hi> are not inferiour to the <hi>Germans.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Zouglan</hi> Seraſquier, had an Opportunity of throwing Succours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Place three times, in ſpite of the German Army; whoſe Lines were either not well made, or not well enough guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. It is alſo ſaid, That the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having attempted to engage him more than once to a Battel, he had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to get away, without engaging, after he had accompliſhed his Will. At length the Chriſtian Army, after having loſt a world of Men, not only by the Fights it had ſuſtained, but alſo by Want and ill Weather, was obliged to raiſe the Siege about the middle of <hi>November.</hi> It was feared that the Seraſquier would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked it in its Retreat; but it had time to make one, without being purſued, and without leaving any thing except ſome diſmounted Cannon, which they took care to bury leaſt the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould make uſe of them. The Seraſquier had Troops e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now, as it is reported; and committed a conſiderable Fault by hot ſetting upon this Army in its Retreat; which being ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd as it was, could not have held out before him, according to all appearance. He contented himſelf with ſending the <hi>Tartars</hi> into the Iſle of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> where
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110070:108"/>they killed ſome diſtemper'd Souldiers; and choſe rather to follow the Maxim of thoſe, who ſay, that one ſhould make a Bridg of Gold for his Enemies, rather than hazard his Army againſt Men, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would fight like deſperate Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Siege of <hi>Buda,</hi> General <hi>Schultz</hi> made War upon the Male-contents in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-Hungary,</hi> with a ſmall Body of an Army, and much more Succeſs. He took in the Month of <hi>September, Seben,</hi> a little City at two Leagues diſtance from <hi>Eperies,</hi> where he made the Gariſon, which <hi>Teckely</hi> had thrown in a day before, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of War; the Inhabitants having ſurrendered in ſpite of it, by reaſon of the Inconvenience which the Bombs had caus'd them. The <hi>Hungarians</hi> of this Gariſon were cut in pieces by <hi>Baragozzi,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <hi>Teckely</hi> of having impaled ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Regiment; and who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt all the party, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Death of his two Brothers. <hi>Zeban,</hi> which <hi>Teckely</hi> thought would have reſiſted longer, being taken; <hi>Schultz</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered every one of his Horſe-men to take a Foot-Souldier behind him, and marched upon the 17th of <hi>September,</hi> in the night, directly to the Camp of <hi>Teckely;</hi> where being arrived by break of day, he ſet upon him with ſo much Expedition, that he had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110070:108"/>not time to call his Troops to Arms, nor to put himſelf in a Condition of defence, as he might eaſily have done, if he had been advertiſed. <hi>Teckely</hi> thought that the ſureſt way, in this occaſion, was to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his Baggage and his Ammunition to the <hi>Germans,</hi> who would amuze themſelves by pillaging, inſtead of following him. And it happened ſo; the <hi>Germans,</hi> who had marched in the night, being glad to find where-withal to refeſh themſelves in the Camp of the Male-contents. General <hi>Schultz</hi> advanced, notwithſtanding, the ſame day, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

The General was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to turn upon another ſide; and took, without much reſiſtance, <hi>Barsfeld,</hi> and the Caſtles of <hi>Stropho, Makowitz,</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawitz.</hi> The Army which <hi>Teckely</hi> had then, was too ſmall to keep the field, and the greateſt part of his Troops were in Gariſon in divers important Places. The Burgeſſes of Cities not being very well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the Party, or wanting Courage, did not oppoſe the Imperial Troops, when they had left them the Care of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and they held not Men enough to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110070:109"/>furniſh all the Cities they had a mind to hold; and to form, at the ſame time, a Body of an Army able to undertake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> after the Imperial Army was gone, made ſeveral Incurſions towards <hi>Vicegrad</hi> and <hi>Grana;</hi> nevertheleſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attempting any thing conſiderable: but upon the other Bank of the <hi>Danube,</hi> they took <hi>Weitzen,</hi> whoſe Gariſon was for the moſt part out in pieces, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they had cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Imperial Troops took their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Quarters in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and upon the Frontiers of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> Lands that had been but little cultivated ſince the Turks and Chriſtians had made a havock there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in emulation of one another. So that amongſt the various Hardſhips they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured there, Famine was the greateſt. The Souldiers diſpoſſeſſed the Country-People of the ſmall Proviſions which they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110070:109"/>had left, and many of theſe unhappy Wretches were obliged to go to <hi>Buda,</hi> and to other Places of the Turks, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get Bread. The Governour of <hi>Buda</hi> received a good number of them, whom he put to repair the Fortifications of the Place.</p>
                  <p>The Troops of General <hi>Schultz</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, like the reſt, in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-Hungary,</hi> which was not leſs havock'd than the <hi>Lower;</hi> inſomuch, that he was obliged to retire near <hi>Eperies,</hi> where he poſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in order to attempt the obtaining of the City, by incommoding the Gariſon. <hi>Teckely</hi> being adviſed of his Retreat, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him in haſte, and entirely defeated his Rear. <hi>Schultz</hi> had Orders after that, to ſupport the Blockade of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> and had ſome Horſe appointed to him, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any entrance therein. But <hi>Teckely</hi> having a Charge from the Grand-Signor to victual the Place, he attended the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, with three thouſand Horſe, and threw therein, in ſpite of <hi>Schultz,</hi> three hundred Chariots of Proviſions, and three hundred Horſe-men, who carried each a Sack of Meal behind him. Some days after there entred a ſecond Convoy, which brought above two thouſand Sacks of Meal. In the beginning of <hi>February</hi> the Turks attempted to put other Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Town for its Defence; but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110070:110"/>they were twice repulſed with loſs, by the Imperialiſts. A few days after, <hi>Tecke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> having, unawares, aſſaulted General <hi>Schultz,</hi> who had beat the Turks, he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led 900 of his Men, and took all his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, which he brought off with 400 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. Thus he revenged the Affront, which t'other had given him near <hi>Eperies,</hi> and alſo routed a Bayarian Regiment, which was in Quarters at <hi>Neudorf;</hi> after which, he introduced, in ſafety, a Convoy within <hi>Newhauſel.</hi> In vain did <hi>Schultz</hi> pretend to become Maſter of the Caſtle of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngwar;</hi> he was obliged to retire after he had ſuſtained ſome loſs. But Colonel <hi>Heuſler</hi> beat ſeveral Parties of the Turks, retook <hi>Weitzen,</hi> and put the Gariſon to the Sword; but being unable to undertake to keep the Place, nor to carry off the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition which he found therein, he ſet fire to it.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>May, Schultz</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned before <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngwar</hi> to endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Revenge. He took in five days the lower Town, made a vigorous Attack upon the Caſtle, and rendred himſelf Maſter of ſome Works, but not without loſs. A Party of the Troops of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents being advanced to ſuccour the Place, he went to meet them, and gave them a Defeat; but as he returned, and made no queſtion of winning this Caſtle
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110070:110"/>in few days, he had Advice that <hi>Teckely</hi> came forward with a conſiderable Body: He did not think himſelf in a Condition to attend him, and rather choſe to leave his Cannon, than to be ſurprized.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> at length took the Field with the Forces of the Emperor, which amounted to 24 or 25000 Men, and with the Troops of the Empire, ought to make an Army of 60000. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſidered ſome time whether he ſhould beſiege <hi>Novigrad,</hi> and after that, march to <hi>Buda,</hi> as it had been projected before the Campaign, he determined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Siege of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> and went to encamp before the Place upon the 16th of <hi>July.</hi> He preſſed it with as much Vigour, as the German Armies are accuſtomed to attack any place; but the Turks did not defend themſelves ill, and there paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Month before they had hopes of reducing the Gariſon to capitulate. This gave the Seraſquier an Opportunity of advancing with an Army of 60000 Men, on t'other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> to take <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grad,</hi> and form the Siege of <hi>Gran.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having notice of it, and fearing leſt the Seraſquier ſhould obtain it in few days, and then come upon him with all his Troops, reſolved, after ſome Conſultations, to go and aſſault him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Imperial Army was more fatigued,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110070:111"/>than it was by the Siege of <hi>Newhauſel.</hi> He left before the Place a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Troops to repulſe the Efforts of the Gariſon, whilſt the reſt of the Army was abſent, and to advance the Works as much as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 8th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Comora,</hi> upon two Bridges, and his Army advanced towards <hi>Gran</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Battel. The next day he met the Commander of <hi>Vicegrad,</hi> with 70 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who had ſurrendred after 12 days Reſiſtance. The 11th he arrived in ſight of <hi>Gran,</hi> and the Turks, informed of his March, after having raiſed the Siege up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 10th, and ſent their great Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to <hi>Buda,</hi> went to meet him, under the Conduct of the Seraſquier. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> being adviſed of the raiſing of the Siege, did not ceaſe to ſend Relief to <hi>Gran,</hi> in caſe the Turks ſhould recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence the Siege a-new. In the mean time, having learn'd that the Seraſquier had an Army of above 60000 Men, and approached with a Deſign to fight the Chriſtian Army, who were not above 40000; he reſolved to withdraw to a place, where the two Wings being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered on one ſide by the <hi>Danube,</hi> and on the other by the Mountains, he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage without apprehenſion of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved. The Imperialiſts arrived there
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110070:111"/>the 16th, and put themſelves in order of Battel, in expectation of the Turks, who had not failed to purſue them as ſoon as they found they had diſlodged. Having rank'd themſelves in battel Array at their leiſure, by reaſon of a Miſt that aroſe at Day-break, and which entirely kept them from the ſight of the Turks, they received theſe laſt, who purſued them as if they had fled, with ſo much Firmneſs and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they could never diſcompoſe them, altho they came ſeveral times to the Charge. The Chriſtian Army having thus eſcaped their firſt Fury, began to charge them in its turn, in advancing a little, and thundring much more violent upon them than before. The Turks were ſoon after in diſorder, notwithſtanding the Seraſquier, (who was wounded in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming excellently his Duty) did all that was poſſible to prevent it. At length they fled towards their Camp, beyond a Marſh, which covered them upon one ſide. They ſtopt a little in this Poſt, but not imagining themſelves ſecure there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had filled up part of the Marſh, in order to purſue the Chriſtian Army, they marched on further, after they had taken away all they could in their Camp as they paſſed. The Chriſtians, who marched in order, for fear the Turks ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying ſhould ſuddenly come and fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110070:112"/>on them, advanced to the Marſh, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards entred the Camp of the Turks, where they found their Artillery, and a good quantity of Ammunition.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Army of the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> was beating the Turks, the Count <hi>Caprara</hi> preſs'd <hi>Newhauſel</hi> more and more. The Gariſon being reduced from 3000 to 1700 Men, the Commander dead of his Wounds, and divers other Officers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe killed or wounded, the Place was taken by Aſſault the 19th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Forces of the Turks being all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> in the <hi>Lower-Hungary,</hi> or in <hi>Croatia,</hi> where Count <hi>Leſle</hi> got ſeveral Advantages over them, which we don't intend to recite; <hi>Teckely,</hi> in vain, demanded Succour of the Seraſquier. That was the cauſe of the taking of <hi>Eperies,</hi> whoſe Fortifications were as yet unfiniſhed. General <hi>Schultz</hi> took it by Compoſition upon the 11th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 22 days after the Trenches were opened. The Capitulation was, That the Commander, who was a German, and had ſerved in the Quality of Colonel in the Troops of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in thoſe of the Emperor: That the German Souldiers ſhould have the ſame Advantage: That the Hungarians might likewiſe enter into the ſame Troops, or retire where they pleaſed, after having
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110070:112"/>received a Month's Pay from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of <hi>Eperies:</hi> That the Citizens ſhould enjoy the ſame Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which the Emperor had allowed to other Cities that had returned to their Obedience: That the Nobility ſhould remain unmoleſted in their Eſtates, after having ſworn a new Oath of Fidelity to the Emperor: That the Magiſtrates ſhould retain their Offices, and that a general Pardon ſhould be given for all that is paſt. This Capitulation, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body was equally included, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red enough that there was a Wearineſs of holding for a Party, which every day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more weak. <hi>Peterhaſi,</hi> one of the chief Male-contents, came ſome Weeks after to the Camp of <hi>Schultz</hi> to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf, with ſix hundred Men, in order to enjoy the Benefit of the Act of Oblivion; to which he was immediately received. After that, the Seraſquier thought only upon ſeparating his Troops, and to ſix them in thoſe places which he judged to be moſt expoſed. He ſent ſome to <hi>Agria</hi> and <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> which the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts had begun to attack. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>de Merci,</hi> began alſo with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments the Blockade of <hi>Agria,</hi> altho he had much ado to ſubſiſt about this Place; the Baſſa having cut off or ſpoil'd all the Forage, in the apprehenſion of a Siege.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110070:113"/>The Turks being in pain for themſelves, did not conſider <hi>Teckely,</hi> who, in the weak Circumſtances he was in, ſuffered <hi>Tokai</hi> to be taken with ſome other Places of ſmall note.</p>
                  <p>About the end of <hi>September,</hi> the Count <hi>Caprara</hi> was diſpatch'd with new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits to command the Army of Upper <hi>Hungary</hi> in the place of <hi>Schultz.</hi> He marched directly to <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> and inveſted it the ſecond of <hi>October,</hi> without being able notwithſtanding to prevent the Counts of <hi>Aſtrowitz</hi> and ſome others from throwing themſelves in it with Troops. They made a very vigorous Reſiſtance immediately, and found themſelves in a condition of holding out a good while; but <hi>Teckely</hi> who had a Body of 7 or 8000 Men only, was not in a ſtate of relieving it, and feared with reaſon that it would be taken, if not ſupported. He had a long time demanded Succors of the Baſſa of <hi>Great Waradin,</hi> to maintain himſelf againſt the Imperial Army, without receiving any; and he redoubled his Inſtances as ſoon as <hi>Caſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> was beſieged. The Baſſa replied, that he could undertake nothing without the expreſs Orders of the Grand Signior, which he expected every day. A little while after he ſent to inform <hi>Teckely,</hi> that he had received Orders with poſitive Commands to diſcover them to none but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110070:113"/>him, and that he pray'd him to repair to <hi>Waradin,</hi> in order to confer together. Thereupon <hi>Teckely</hi> accompanied with his Army, advanced that way with <hi>Petrozzi</hi> and his chief Officers. The Baſſa came to meet them, and invited them into the City, which they entred at the Diſcharge of all the Artillery. The Army encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Place, whilſt the Officers were regaled by the Baſſa who was extreamly civil to them. But at the concluſion of the Feaſt, when <hi>Teckely</hi> expected to enter into a private Conference, certain Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries came into the Room with Chains, wherewith they bound him by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Baſſa, who ſaid he had received this Order from the Port. As for the other Officers, he civilly ſent them back to their Troops, and told <hi>Petrozzi</hi> that he might put himſelf at the Head of them, and conduct Affairs till new Orders. In all appearance the Seraſquier, or ſome other Turkiſh Officer had accuſed <hi>Teckely,</hi> to juſtify himſelf in the ſenſe of the Grand Signior, whom the ill Fortune of the War had incenſed againſt his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, as if it had been by their fault that the Imperialiſts had obtained ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Advantages, and taken ſo many Places. It ſeemed that if <hi>Teckely</hi> had diſcharged his Duty as he ſhould, he muſt have made a greater Diverſion of the Imperial
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110070:114"/>Troops, and they have gained conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably leſs.</p>
                  <p>The unſeaſonableneſs of the ill Policy of the Turks had like to have ruined en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the Malecontents Party, and really brought it a Prejudice which it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince repair. <hi>Petrozzi,</hi> either frighted at the Impriſonment of <hi>Teckely,</hi> or elſe weary of the Fatigues of War, diſpoſed the Officers and Troops which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to accept the general Pardon which the Emperor offered to thoſe who would embrace his Party. This Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a Head, and not knowing what courſe to take without the Aſſiſtance of the Turks, was eaſily perſwaded; and Deputies were ſent in his Name to <hi>Capra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> to know if he would receive him. <hi>Caprara</hi> joyfully received them all, and engaged himſelf to let them enjoy the general Pardon, after which they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to his Camp. They took a new Oath of Fidelity, and thoſe who had a mind to be concerned in the Emperor's Troops, remain'd there. The Gariſon of <hi>Caſſovia</hi> underſtanding how things were carried, judged Count <hi>Teckely</hi> to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely loſt, and followed their Example. The Conditions of its Surrender were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Eperies.</hi> They likewiſe ſeized upon other Places of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> whereof the Malecontents were
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110070:114"/>poſſeſs'd, and they found in <hi>Zolnock</hi>'s conſiderable quantity of Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time the Imperialiſts ſent <hi>Petrozzi</hi> with a Convoy to <hi>Mongatz</hi> to let the Princeſs, the Wife of <hi>Teckely,</hi> know what had befallen her Husband, and to diſpoſe her to reſign this Fortreſs to the Emperor, and alſo that of <hi>Patack,</hi> which ſhe ſtill maintained, ſince at leaſt there was no poſſibility of ſaving her Husband, nor re-eſtabliſhing the Party. She anſwered, that ſhe could not believe her Husband had been ſeized on; and that if ſo be he was advanced into the Turkiſh Territories, it was only to conſult of Meaſures with the Grand Signior for the enſuing Campaign. Upon this Reply <hi>Patack</hi> was aſſaulted, which was taken in a few days, and they began the Blockade of <hi>Mongatz.</hi>

In the beginning of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Year, the Princeſs publiſhed Letters, as dated from <hi>Belgrade</hi> by her Husband, wherein he obſerved to her that his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence had been acknowledged at the Port, and that a Baſſa, who had accuſed him, and arreſted him without Order, was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to give him Reparation of Honour. He added, that he only waited for the new Seraſquier, in order to take the Field with him, and that he would ſoon raiſe the Blockade of <hi>Mongatz,</hi> exhorting his Wife to hearken to no Propoſals of Peace.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110070:115"/>Whether theſe Letters were real or no, it is certain that the Turks were ſoon convinced of the fault they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in arreſting the Head of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents at ſo dangerous a Conjuncture; and inſtead of miſuſing him, he was ſet at Liberty, to ſee whether they could act with Succeſs, under his means againſt the Imperialiſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caprara</hi> about this time wrote a Letter to the Princeſs, and repreſented to her, that in the Extremity to which the Affairs of the Party were reduced, the Count her Husband being arreſted by the Turks, and the greateſt part of the Malecontents returned to their Duty, it was time for her likewiſe to indemnify her ſelf with her Family, in having recourſe to the Mercy of the Emperor. She anſwered, that ſhe was not of opinion, that ſhe had offered this Prince any occaſion of making War againſt her; and that being Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian to thoſe Children ſhe had had by the Prince <hi>Ragotski,</hi> ſhe was obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to them, as much as poſſibly ſhe could, the Places which had appertained to their Father: That it was no occaſion of ſurprize to find a Mother defending the Rights of her Children, or a Wife not declaring againſt her Husband. That what was affirmed of his Impriſonment, was nothing but a Fiction, ſince he would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110070:115"/>appear the following Campaign: In ſhort, that there was no Reputation for thoſe who uſed their Endeavours to diſpoſſeſs Orphans, and to force a Caſtle defended by a Woman. <hi>Caprara</hi> thereupon diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf to the Siege of <hi>Mongatz</hi> which required much time, this Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeated upon a very high Rock, ſteep on all ſides, and hardly to be reduced but by Famine.

                  <p>The Turks continuing to make little Progreſs in their Affairs, ſoon after had a ſenſe of the Diſadvantage they had given themſelves by the apprehenſion of <hi>Teckely,</hi> not only by the weakning of the whole Party of Malecontents, but alſo by the taking of <hi>Lippa,</hi> a City between the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Maros,</hi> the <hi>Teys</hi> and the <hi>Danube,</hi> where they had great Magazines. This City being ſecured by a River and <hi>Great Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin,</hi> appeared to be out of danger; but the Imperial Horſe, being accompanied with <hi>Hungarians,</hi> to whom this Country was perfectly known, and having nothing to fear elſewhere, advanced ſo far, and gain'd all the Ammunition and Proviſions that were found therein.

They have been ſeen to be re-eſtabliſhed, when <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Boskai, Gabriel Betlem,</hi> and <hi>George Ragotski,</hi> demanded at the Head of an Army, the performance of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations granted by your firſt Kings, and whereof their Succeſſors had ſwonn the Obſervation at their coming to the Crown. But how long have theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations endured? As long as they who had obtained them, have been in a condition to preſerve you in thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties which they had procured you.</p>
                              <p>Why ſhould <hi>Vienna</hi> delivered, <hi>Gran</hi> and <hi>Newhauſel</hi> re-taken, make you ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Circumſtances of the Turks?
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110070:117"/>The Vigor with which they defended <hi>Buda</hi> laſt Campaign, ought to convince you of their Forces. What the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror can oppoſe againſt them, can't be ſuppoſed very conſiderable; and one may ſay that his Funds for the Payment of his Army are but ill aſſured. If the preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Pope ſhould ſhut up his Purſe, or after him another ſhould ſucceed of leſs Zeal for Religion, ſhould you not ſee this great Body diſperſe it ſelf for want of Maintenance? Can you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark your ſelves upon ſo weak a Veſſel, which is in danger of being ſplit againſt the leaſt Rock it encounters? Let the <hi>Venetians</hi> ceaſe to divert a part of the Ottoman Forces in the <hi>Morea,</hi> let the <hi>Poles</hi> be weary of diſputing a Paſſage with the <hi>Tartars;</hi> Let the Pope withdraw his Succours, can you expect not to be the Victims of your own Credulity, and the firſt cruſh'd in pieces by the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Power of an Enemy, who reigns in three parts of the World?</p>
                              <p>You cannot fix any Confidence in the word of a Prince, who is inceſſantly beſieged by certain Perſons, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring all things to their Paſſions, and not knowing what it is to govern People, concern themſelves in what they do not underſtand.

'Tis, in a word, <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Terſats,</hi> Count of <hi>Frangipani,</hi> equally illuſtrious for the Antiquity of his Nobility, and his perſonal Qualities. All theſe have periſhed by relying on their Faith.</p>
                              <p>What Formalities have been obſerved in their Trials? Were they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their natural Judges, purſuant
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110070:119"/>to the Rights of the Hungarians? By no means; They had Commiſſioners allowed them that were all Strangers, ignorant in our Laws, and devoted to thoſe who were fixed upon their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the matter; notwithſtanding they pronounced their Sentences upon <hi>Nadaſti,</hi> in <hi>Vienna,</hi> and upon the other two Counts at <hi>Neuſtad,</hi> upon the 30th of <hi>April</hi> 1671, before they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Reality of what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt them.</p>
                              <p>The Cruelty of the Emperor's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters did not ſtop there: You have ſeen a Chamber eſtabliſhed at <hi>Presburgh,</hi> which has put into the hands of the Executioners, all thoſe whoſe Eſtates excited their Avarice, or whoſe Zeal for the Preſervation of your Liberty, gave them any Suſpicion. Amongſt all theſe unhappy Perſons, you ought in particular to regret <hi>Francis Bouis;</hi> who
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110070:119"/>had been the firſt Aſſeſſor of the County of <hi>Zemlin,</hi> whom you have often ſeen to ſupport, with an unſhaken Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the Freedom of his Country, and the Reformed Religion.</p>
                              <p>When King <hi>Leopold,</hi> who reigns at preſent, would aboliſh your Privileges, and make you Slaves, he doth but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue therein the Footſteps of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, who have forgot nothing to render the Crown of <hi>Hungary</hi> heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to their Houſe. You know that the States of this Kingdom have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enjoyed the Privilege of electing your Kings. One reads in your Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, that all thoſe who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Firſt, came to the Crown by this means alone; but this Prince, who was the firſt Hungarian King of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family, took a Method extreamly different. He tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted with <hi>John Sepuſa,</hi> without the Participation of the States, as if one or t'other had the Propriety thereof, and it had been an Inheritance, of which they enjoyed the free and abſolute Diſpoſal. In the mean time, you know that your Kings are but the Uſufructu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of their Dominions. You have taken them to defend you againſt your Adverſaries, and to preſerve your Rights. At the moment they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110070:120"/>them, they have actually and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally forfeited the Soveraignty, and you are diſpenſed from the Oath of Fidelity and Obedience that you have taken to them.</p>
                              <p>Notwithſtanding, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was not contented with the Diviſion he had made with <hi>Sepuſa.</hi> He compelled this diſpoſſeſſed Prince to have recourſe to <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and after that to <hi>Solyman,</hi> when he found that he could not ſupport himſelf by the Aſſiſtance of the firſt. 'Tis this Treaty which has afforded a Pretence to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and his Succeſſors, to impoſe upon you that Yoke, under which you have groaned ſince that time. Their Partiſans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That you had ſought the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Turks againſt your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and that <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                                 <hi>Solyman</hi> having taken <hi>Buda,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the other Places of <hi>Hungary,</hi> reſtored them to <hi>John Sepuſa,</hi> without exacting any thing of him; but after the Death of this Prince, when <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> would have deprived his Widow <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and his Son <hi>John</hi> the 2d, this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110070:120"/>unfortunate Widow was conſtrained to have recourſe once more to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>Solyman;</hi> who for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the War, retained <hi>Buda, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que-Eccleſiae, Alba Regalis,</hi> and <hi>Gran.</hi> The Auſtrians can't deny that <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> offered to pay <hi>Solyman</hi> for each Hungarian a Crown tribute, if he would refuſe his Protection to <hi>Sepuſa.</hi> It is true, that this Prince diſowned the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador that he had diſpatched to the Port, when he received Advice that he had been ſtop'd by <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> as he croſs'd over <hi>Poland,</hi> altho his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons directed it in expreſs Terms. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how the Princes of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family are become Maſters of <hi>Hungary.</hi> Let us ſee now what Methods they have practiſed to render this Crown heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in their Houſe.</p>
                              <p>The firſt thing they attempted, was to divide you, under pretence of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Religion: They perſwaded the Roman-Catholicks, that the Proteſtants had drawn the Turks into <hi>Hungary,</hi> to the end of incenſing the Firſt againſt the Proteſtants: Notwithſtanding, it is eaſy enough to know the contrary by the Letter which <hi>John Sepuſa</hi> wrote to <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th; by which he makes it appear, that the Threats which <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> made to <hi>Solyman,</hi> by his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110070:121"/>diſpoſed him to turn his Arms againſt this deſolate Kingdom.</p>
                              <p>Although, by ſeveral Treaties, the Kings of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to leave the Proteſtants the free Exerciſe of their Religion, they have not ceaſed to deprive them of their Churches and their Schools. This is what's expreſly born by the Treaty of <hi>Vienna,</hi> made with <hi>Boſcai,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed after that by a Declaration of the Arch-duke <hi>Matthias;</hi> who has been ſince Emperor, and King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> In 1608, this Liberty of Religion was extended to the very Peaſants of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 2d, confirmed the Declarations of his Predeceſſors at his Coronation. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 3d, did the ſame thing in 1647. And there was a Declaration of the like nature in 1655. Nevertheleſs, in ſpite of ſo many Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances, ſo often repeated, the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans have not failed to ſeize upon the great Church of <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> after having broke open the Doors, and have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd the Proteſtants of the uſe thereof. Next they ſurpriz'd that of <hi>Newfol,</hi> a City of the Mountains, in the night-time, whilſt the People ſlept; and as <hi>Newſol</hi> was fortified, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it by ſcaling. I can't relate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Horror, what Cruelties they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110070:121"/>in the Church of <hi>Thalia,</hi> a little Village, when they became Maſters of it. They committed Rapes therein, and diſpoſed themſelves to all ſorts of Exceſs. Judg if theſe Extremities are the Ways to bring back, into the boſom the Church, thoſe whom they call ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Nevertheleſs, they engaged the Catholicks of the Kingdom to take Arms with them, in order to chaſe the Proteſtants from their Churches and their Schools.</p>
                              <p>The Miniſters of the Emperor, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſowed amongſt you the Spirit of Diviſion, to weaken you, deprived the Hungarians of all the Charges, and all the Governments, againſt your Rights, to become Maſters of Places. Then they ſupplied them with German Gariſons, under pretence of defending them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turks, whoſe Aſſaults, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to thoſe Places, they ſaid they ſuddenly expected. To know by what Motive the Emperor introduced theſe foreign Troops into <hi>Hungary,</hi> one muſt examine two things: 1ſt. If the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, before it was ſubject to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> defended it ſelf ill againſt the Infidels: And <hi>2dly,</hi> If thoſe Troops, which are pretended to have been ſent to your aſſiſtance have treated you with Civility, and applied themſelves to your Intereſts.</p>
                              <pb n="44" facs="tcp:110070:122"/>
                              <p>As for what relates to the firſt Point, let us aſcend to the time of the Huni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades and the Corvins, and we ſhall find that <hi>Hungary</hi> has been the Bulwark of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Since that time, if ſo be this Kingdom has loſt any thing becauſe the Succeſſors of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> have drawn out its Forces. Notwithſtanding, they ſend you Germans, under a pretence of ſupporting you, and theſe Germans treat you with more Inhumanity than ever did the Turks and Tartars. They deſtroy your Harveſts, they take away your Goods, they diſhonour your Wives and your Daughters; and ſet fire to your Houſes, after having filled them with Slaughter. What could your moſt cruel Enemies do to you worſe? At the ſame time, if you dare complain, they accuſe you of Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and tell you that you miſufe thoſe  who are ſent to your aſſiſtance.</p>
                              <p>They interpret that revenge, a Crime, which you took of 300 Muſqueteers, in the Town of <hi>Ker:</hi> and they report, as an extraordinary Effect of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Clemency, the Goodneſs he made appear by leaving their Deaths unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; as if theſe Souldiers had not deferved it, having before maſſacre'd a Gentleman of the Ancient Nobility,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110070:122"/>who had exerciſed the Charge of ſworn Aſſeſſor in the County of <hi>Abanvivar,</hi> altho they could accuſe him of nothing more than an Unwillingneſs to ſatisfy their inſatiable Avarice. It is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, by all Laws, Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, to repulſe Force with Force, when there's no other way to obtain Juſtice? They ſay, that you purſued the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Souldiers, with Forks and Clubs; but ſince the Peaſants have no other Arms, they might well uſe them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Goods againſt theſe Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                              <p>They propoſe to you, for an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Emperor's Humanity towards the Prince <hi>Ragotski,</hi> whom he re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in his Poſſeſſion, altho his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, after having diſunited <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> from <hi>Hungary,</hi> made it tributary to the Port, and notwithſtanding he had himſelf been one of the heads of the laſt Rebellion. Can a thing of ſo little Truth be advanced; and dares any one affirm, that this Prince was favourably dealt with, when all his Moveables were taken away, and he deprived of the Places of <hi>Erſchot, Patak, Onod, Tokai, Saros</hi> and <hi>Trentſchin;</hi> and that his Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow is held cloſe block'd up in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatz,</hi> which is the only Place remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her?</p>
                              <pb n="46" facs="tcp:110070:123"/>
                              <p>They accuſe the Proteſtants of having ſuffered <hi>Waradin</hi> to be loſt, and of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That they had rather hear the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> of the Turks, than the <hi>Allelujah</hi> of the Papiſts. Was there ever Malice ſo inveterate? <hi>Martin Bredoay,</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Belemerſi,</hi> who are ſtill living, can teſtify, that they were ſent to <hi>Souches,</hi> General of the Imperial Army, to preſs him to diſpatch Succours to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged; and that he would never quit his Poſt, nor make one Detachment march that way. When the Place was taken by the Turks, Prince <hi>Porcia,</hi> to excuſe this Negligence, after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered upon the Map the Situation of <hi>Waradin,</hi> told the Emperor, that it was no great loſs, that it was no better than a Hog-ſty: Thoſe are his very Terms.</p>
                              <p>They would alſo perſwade you, that they diſtinguiſh the Loyal Hungarians from the Rebels; and that thoſe, who have not taken up Arms againſt their Soveraign, are for that reaſon exempted from the Taxes, which are impoſed on them, for the ſupport of the foreign Gariſons. Is not this attempting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Liberty, and infringing your Privileges, when they lay Taxes upon you? Is it not directed, by the Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, that the King can impoſe nothing without the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110070:123"/>conſent of the States, and an urgent Neceſſity? Notwithſtanding, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King will be Maſter of them, and pretends that they depend upon his ſingle Will and Pleaſure.</p>
                              <p>In order to have a Pretence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving you of your Rights, it is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that the Revolt has been univerſal, and that no Perſon is exempt; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having juſtified, by the Declaration of <hi>Andrew</hi> the 2d, that you might le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally take up Arms for the defence of your Liberty, I will alſo give you an Example to demonſtrate, that you have a Right to depoſe your Kings, when they contravene thoſe Conditions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they have received the Crown. <hi>Petrus Germanicus</hi> was, as King <hi>Leopold</hi> doth now, for giving the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Kingdom to Strangers, for putting into places German Gariſons, and for making Impoſitions, of his own motion, without the Approbation of the States. Theſe very States, incenſed at ſo many Infractions, depoſed him, and elected <hi>Abas</hi> to reign in his ſtead.</p>
                              <p>They would give a falſe Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Ordinance of <hi>Andrew</hi> the 2d; and make Men believe that the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Prince was only to commit to the Palatine the care of maintaining in this Kingdom the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110070:124"/>and of preventing the Alteration of its Purity; but if one well conſiders the Terms, one muſt be convinced that it concerns Privileges and not Religion.</p>
                              <p>The Auſtrians pretend to juſtify the Execution of the three Counts, by two ways. The firſt is drawn from the Examples of Count <hi>Lambert de Maylath</hi> and his Accomplices, whom <hi>Bela</hi> put to Death for having taken up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; from <hi>John Ban</hi> of <hi>Croatia,</hi> from <hi>Konnez, Herdivara,</hi> and 30 other Lords, whom <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> Emperor, and King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſent to puniſhment for a like Occaſion; and from <hi>Stephen Vaivod</hi> of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> who loſt his Head by order of the ſame Prince. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is founded upon the Moderation which the preſent King ſhewed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Sentence of the three Counts, when he remitted that part of it which referred to the Hand's being cut off.</p>
                              <p>As for the Examples, they have no conſiſtence with the unjuſt Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Defenders of your Liberty. The Count <hi>Lambert</hi> having caſt himſelf at the King's feet, his own Brother pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him away, and broke his Head with a Joint-ſtool, which he had ſeized on. This very Brother dragg'd <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Son of the Count, even to the King's
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110070:124"/>Throne, and made his Head to be cut off in his Preſence. The other Lords were maſſacred in the Hall of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. The Rebellion of <hi>Kennez</hi> and <hi>Herdivara,</hi> was alſo ſufficiently proved; and <hi>Stephen</hi> the <hi>Vaivod</hi> had been duly cited, before he was arreſted. Can the ſame thing be aſſerted of the Counts <hi>Nadaſti, Serini,</hi> and <hi>Frangipani?</hi> Was there any Formality obſerved in their Trial? There was no Accuſer, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the Judges were Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the Laws of the Kingdom were not purſued. If <hi>Nadaſti</hi> was a Criminal, his Crime was annulled by the Emperor's Pardon; and the other two came of themſelves to <hi>Vienna,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aſſurance which had been given them of a favourable Uſage.

One finds in the ſacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, that the People of God have joined their Arms to thoſe of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110070:125"/>Princes. The <hi>Auſtrians</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> of this very Family, who affect the Name of Catholicks, have often treated Alliances with theſe very Infidels. In theſe latter Times the <hi>Poles</hi> have made no ſcruple of entring into a League with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> to make War upon the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>

                              <p>When we complain that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are chaſed from their Temples, it is replied, that the Catholicks have only reſtored themſelves to the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Churches which had been taken from them. In the mean time, all the World knows that thoſe of our Communion have taken none but thoſe that were abandoned, which one may eaſily be ſatisfied in by the Deſcription that <hi>George Dracowits,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Eccleſiae,</hi> has made of the unhappy State wherein the Church and Clergy of <hi>Hungary</hi> were at that time. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Catholicks had ſome right in thoſe Churches whereof the Proteſtants were in Poſſeſſion, the ſame was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the Tranſaction of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which adjudged them to thoſe of our Communion.</p>
                              <p>After having explain'd to you, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Hungarians,</hi> the Artifices which your Enemies make uſe of, to cry down your Conduct, and to make you fall

                  <p>This Manifeſto, which might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced great Effects in the beginning of a Rebellion, when People full of hopes have not as yet ſeen any ill Conſequence of their Attempts, was not capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging afreſh Perſons diſguſted with ſo tedious and unſucceſsful a War; if one did not excite their languiſhing Courage by an Aſſiſtance capable of ſupporting them, and give them a proſpect of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what they had vainly expected hitherto. Therefore <hi>Teckely</hi> ſoon after marched at the head of a Body of Troops, mix'd with <hi>Hungarians, Tranſylvanians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who compoſed an Army of 9 or 10000 Men. He came to encamp near
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110070:126"/>
                     <hi>Great Waradin,</hi> where he had a Reception extreamly different from the other, and from whence he ſent to adviſe thoſe of <hi>Mongatz</hi> of his March, and to ſollicite every where his ancient Friends to rejoin him.</p>
                  <p>The Gariſon of <hi>Mongatz,</hi> enlivened by this News, made a Sally of 600 Men, wherein they ſhock'd the Imperialiſts with ſo much Courage, that they killed above 300 of them, ſeized upon a Redoubt, which they had raiſed, and ſo delivered the lower Town from an Inconvenience, which began to render the Abode there dangerous.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Count <hi>Caprara</hi> ſeized upon another Poſt, by which means he hindred the Inhabitants of the Town from going to fetch Water at the River, from whence he hoped in a little time to draw a great Advantage againſt them. But the Town being full of Ciſterns, which had been filled by the great Rains which had newly fallen, that did not much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode the Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Count <hi>Teckely,</hi> inſtead of taking to the right towards <hi>Mongatz,</hi> as it was ſuppoſed he would, marched to the left towards <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> at ſome Leagues from <hi>Clauſembourg,</hi> in order to attempt, to ſuprize, or debauch ſome <hi>Hungarian</hi> Troops, which were not far
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110070:126"/>from thence, and whereof the greateſt part had formerly followed his Standards. But theſe Troops being adviſed of his coming, retired towards other <hi>German</hi> Troops, and <hi>Teckely</hi> would not undertake to follow them, nor to force them. He was in hopes ſtill, that by little and little he might win them back, by the means of Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had amongſt them; but his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach was fatal to ſome of his Friends, or thoſe who were ſuſpected to be ſo. Several were ordered to be ſeized on, whether they were really culpable, or that it was feigned to be believed, in order to put thoſe Men who were not confided in, out of a condition to do hurt, in caſe they had a deſign. ☜ <hi>Thoſe who have long born Arms againſt their Soveraign, tho they return to their Duty, they are never lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the firſt occaſion that is had to quarrel with them, always ſuffices to deſtroy them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Caraffa</hi> who commanded a Body of an Army of 7000 Men to oppoſe the Deſigns of <hi>Teckely,</hi> followed him ſome few days, without being able to overtake him, in hopes of defeating the new Troops he conducted. But <hi>Teckely</hi> being fixed upon hazarding nothing, and not being well enough aſſured of his new Army, kept near <hi>Waradin,</hi> without attempting any thing. In the mean time <hi>Caraffa</hi> came before
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110070:127"/>
                     <hi>St. Job,</hi> a Town three Leagues from <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin,</hi> and ſupported by a Caſtle, flanked with four Baſtions of Free-ſtone, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with a double Ditch. He ſummoned the Place upon the 9th of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> and the Gariſon replied to him with ſome Vollies of Cannon: he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to force it. Happily for him a Bomb, which fell upon the Magazine of Powder, ſet it on Fire, killed ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and reduced the Gariſon to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, for want of Powder, the 12th of the ſame Month. It went out the next day, and carried to <hi>Waradin</hi> the News of the taking of a Place which was ſuppoſed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reſiſting above a Month. There was found within it eight pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Proviſions, and a great number of Chriſtian Priſoners. The Caſtle, altho little conſiderable of it ſelf, did not ceaſe to put all the Neighbourhood under Contribution, and to annoy the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts. They made the ſame uſe of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> and <hi>Debrezen,</hi> which had been taxed to a certain Sum, as a means to exempt it from Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and had refuſed to pay it, when <hi>Teckely</hi> was near it, was conſtrained to ſubmit to the Conditions of the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts. The <hi>Turks</hi> acted but weakly by reaſon of the Diſorders which had been at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where the Grand-Signor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110070:127"/>had put the Seraſquier to Death, and after that depos'd the Grand-Viſier. <hi>Solyman</hi> who commanded the Army which had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>Poles,</hi> was made Viſier, and could not immediately re-eſtabliſh Order in the Armies of the Grand-Signor.</p>
                  <p>The Affairs of the Port, and the Male-contents being in this condition, it ſeems that a ſmall Effort would abſolutely have quell'd the Party. It had but the ſingle Town of <hi>Mongatz</hi> left, which had been block'd up a long time. This<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Blockade was turn'd into a formal Siege in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>March,</hi> and ſeveral Batteries were prepared to ruine the Caſtle below, and that above. They alſo threw a great quantity of Bombs and Carcaſſes, and left nothing unattempted that might terrify the Inhabitants. But as the Gariſon was compoſed of 4000 Men, and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants affected to the Party, nothing could ſhake them. Beſides, the Situation of the was Place found in the Attacks ſtronger than had been imagined. The lower Town and Caſtle were encompaſs'd with a Ditch very broad and deep, which was full of Water. The Imperialiſts in vain undertook to drain it, and thoſe of the Place found means to introduce Water, which came from ſeveral parts of the Mountains, becauſe the Snows began to melt. In vain therefore did they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110070:128"/>to form an Attack againſt the upper Caſtle: Being ſeated upon an inacceſſible Rock uncommanded, and encompaſs'd with a double Ditch cut into the Rock, a few Men might be able to defend it againſt a great Army. Beſides it happened that the Spring-time was extreamly rainy in <hi>Hungary,</hi> inſomuch that all the Works of the Beſiegers were full of Water. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Army that was there, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed all the Proviſions and Forage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, had much ado to ſubſiſt. <hi>Capra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who had the Conduct of this Siege, ſent Advice to <hi>Vienna</hi> of the condition of his Troops, and of the Siege, which he declared himſelf unabled to continue, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was aſſiſted with Proviſions and Men; but the Imperial Council having other Deſigns, found it more ſeaſonable to abandon this Enterpriſe. So the Siege was raiſed about the end of <hi>April,</hi> after a continuance of two Months, without reckoning the Blockade, which had been formed two Months before. <hi>Teckely,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt the Place ſhould at length be won, uſed his utmoſt Endeavours to get a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Force to go and fall upon <hi>Caprara;</hi> but the Troops which he attempted to recollect in the Neighbourhood in order to this Deſign, having been routed by ſome of the Officers of the Emperor, the Turks were diſguſted at the Enterpriſe;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110070:128"/>and the ill Weather joined to the Scarcity of the Imperial Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Situation of the Place, and the Reſiſtance of the Gariſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaved without them the only place of Refuge which the Male-contents poſſeſſed in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On another ſide, the Imperial. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders having no further Concern with the People of the Country, gain'd ſeveral Advantages over the Turks. The Seraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier with ſome Baſſa's, and <hi>Teckely</hi> being advanced towards <hi>Seged,</hi> with a Body of 4000 Men, were routed without fighting, ſurpriſed by the Baron of <hi>Merci,</hi> inferior in number, but who arrived ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, that they could not know what his Forces were, nor put themſelves in a poſture of Defence.</p>
                  <p>The Imperial Army which was to act againſt the Turks, rendevouz'd between <hi>Barcan</hi> and <hi>Gran,</hi> where it was to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat by the 15th of <hi>May.</hi> It was to be compoſed of above 50000 Men, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as in the preceding Campagnes, by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> It had been diſputed in the Emperor's Council, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Siege of <hi>Buda</hi> ſhould be form'd, or that of ſome other place leſs important, as <hi>Agria,</hi> or <hi>Belgrade.</hi> The Fortifications of <hi>Buda</hi> having been repaired, and the Place provided with all things to ſupport a Siege, with a Gariſon of 10000 Men
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:110070:129"/>commanded by a Renegade; ſome were of opinion, that it hazarded the loſs of a world of Men, and the raiſing of the Siege, as before. But others on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, repreſented that it would prove better than before, becauſe the Place was more known, and that thoſe Faults might be avoided which they had made in the firſt Siege; and if this Deſign ſucceeded, the Emperor might depend upon being ſoon Maſter of all the lower <hi>Hungary.</hi> The chief Officers being of this Advice, all things were diſpoſed for the Execution of it; but the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> could not arrive at the Camp before the 8th of <hi>June.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to ſend more Troops over the <hi>Danube,</hi> it was reſolved to raſe the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of ſeveral Towns of upper <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> to the end of not being oblig'd to hold Gariſons therein, and to hinder <hi>Teckely</hi> from making an Advantage of them. This was done at <hi>Eperies,</hi> and ſome other Places; they alſo thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a condition of obliging <hi>Abaffi,</hi> and the <hi>Tranſylvanians</hi> to declare for the Emperor; and if it ſucceeded, they might be able to make a conſiderable Diverſion on that ſide. Since the Detention of <hi>Teckely, Abaffi</hi> had refuſed the Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents all ſorts of Relief, without attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nevertheleſs any thing againſt them,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:110070:129"/>to manage himſelf at the ſame time with the Emperor and the Grand-Signor, under the uncertainty he was in concerning the end of the War. But to oblige him to determine himſelf, the Count of <hi>Soher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffemberg</hi> was ſent into <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> with 8000 <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> near <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemberg.</hi> The Viſier, who was at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> being adviſed of it, directed ſome <hi>Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian</hi> Troops to march on that ſide, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to act jointly with <hi>Teckely,</hi> and to drive the Imperialiſts out of <hi>Tranſylvania. Scherffemberg</hi> went to meet them, and put them to the rout before they could come near <hi>Waradin.</hi> He ſeized at the ſame time, upon the Paſſage of <hi>Hermanſtadt;</hi> and at length, after having given the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvanians</hi> ſome Reſpite to conſider, upon condition that they ſhould provide for his Army in the mean time, he compelled them to declare themſelves, &amp; to join their Troops with his, which rendred <hi>Teckely</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> incapable of attempting any thing on that ſide. The Count, in not having prevented this Blow, muſt either have ill Spies, or elſe the <hi>Turks</hi> did not make a ſpeedy uſe enough of his Advice. When thoſe who ſee alone what is to be done in order to prevent a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, can't act themſelves to oppoſe it in good time, but are reduced to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune thoſe who ſee it not, it ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110070:130"/>that things are carried on with a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Expedition.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Imperial Army was muſter'd upon the 10th of <hi>June:</hi> It conſiſted of 30000 Foot, and 20000 Horſe, without computing the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and the Troops of the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> which were expected ſtill. It had 16 great Pieces of Cannon, 40 Mortars, and all other Proviſions in proportion. It was divided in two parts, and marched on each ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> by little Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, upon account of the bad Ways. The 18th the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> inveſted the Place, and ordered the making of a Bridg for the other part of the Army to paſs over that was on the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and commanded by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> who had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd that they would return to the Siege of <hi>Buda,</hi> did not at all oppoſe the March of the Army, and did not ſo much as ſend to obſerve it, till it appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Place. I will not inſiſt upon the Circumſtances of this Siege, whoſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory no further relates to the Life of Count <hi>Teckely,</hi> than as the taking of this Place had an Influence in the Affairs of all <hi>Hungary,</hi> and to which the Circumſtances are of no effect.</p>
                  <p>It ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that if the Place was well aſſaulted, according to the method
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:110070:130"/>of the <hi>Germans,</hi> it was as well defended, the Beſieged being reſolved to hold out to Extremity. There was no Obſtruction to the Siege without, till the 12th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the Seraſquier appeared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hills near the <hi>Danube.</hi> After he had encamped there, he put himſelf in order of Battel the next day, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging ſtill with the Imperialiſts, who had exceeded their Lines. It is ſaid that the Turks were 50000 Men, and the Chriſtians not above 40000, the reſt having continued in the Lines. The next day the Turks advanced on farther, and ſome of them crept along a Mountain, which was at the right of the Imperialiſts, with a deſign to get into the Place through the Camp, whilſt the reſt of their Army di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that of the Chriſtians. But the firſt were aſſaulted, and the others vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly repulſed at the ſame time, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to their Camp after having loſt near 2000 Men. Inſtead of returning to the Charge, they decamped in the Night, and went to poſt themſelves three Leagues from thence, where reſided the Grand Viſier. It is ſaid, that this laſt would abſolutely have the Seraſquier return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians, and heard not the Excuſes. Indeed, unleſs the Turkiſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was ſeverely frightned at the loſs it had received, in returning divers times;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110070:131"/>the Imperial Army, which was extreamly fatigued with the Siege, and had been under Arms three days, could hardly have reſiſted long. The 20th, 2000 Janiſaries came again to attack the Lines, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it with ſo much Vigor, that they broke through immediately, and had all unqueſtionably entred the Place, if they had been ſupported as they ought; but there could enter not above 300, whereof the greateſt part were wounded. It is ſaid, that the Viſier gave 30 Crowns to each of the Janiſaries, who in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had perfectly well diſcharged their Duties; but who were not aſſiſted by the <hi>Spahies,</hi> who complained of having been in other Encounters abandoned by the Janiſaries. Thus the Jealouſy there is between thoſe two kinds of Turkiſh Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and the ſmall Experience of their Officers, preſerved the Chriſtian Army at this time. They were contented to appear often in order of Battel in view of the Imperialiſts, who went out of their Lines to receive them, but advanced not up to them when they ſaw them fixed. The Turks attempted once again to break through the Trenches of the Imperialiſts, the 29th of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> but being entred into the Camp on one ſide, whilſt the Viſier made an appearance of going to aſſault it on another, they loſt 7 or 800 Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110070:131"/>being able to pierce as far as the Place. The loſs was ſmall for an Army as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable as that; and which ought to ſave the Place upon any Conditions. In the mean time the Turks not returning to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Lines, the Imperialiſts won <hi>Buda</hi> the 2d of <hi>September,</hi> by a general Aſſault, wherein they broke through the laſt Trenches of the Enemy on three ſides.</p>
                  <p>The Turkiſh Army, which might have prevented the taking of the Place, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Skirmiſhes with the Imperialiſts, did not appear the day whereon the Town was won, and was preparing to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Alba-Regalis.</hi> Having increas'd the Gariſon of this City, it turn'd towards <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> and remained ſome time encamped three Leagues from thence, to obſerve the march of the Imperial Army. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> after having made the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Army reſt three days near <hi>Buda,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow that of the Turks, and went to encamp the 19th of <hi>September</hi> at <hi>Tolna</hi> upon the <hi>Danube;</hi> but the Turks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to engage themſelves in a Battel, he divided his Army, half of which paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> to go and form the Siege of <hi>Seged;</hi> and the other took to the right, with a deſign to inveſt <hi>Quinque Eccleſiae.</hi> The Viſier retired to <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> and put his Troops in Winter-Quarters, whilſt the Imperialiſts obtained theſe two Places, at
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110070:132"/>the end of the Month, beſides ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of leſs note. Count <hi>Veterani</hi> alſo beat a coſiderable Relief that was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Seged;</hi> ſo that it ſeems the Affairs of the Ottoman Empire were generally in a declining ſtate, without a Man found capable to re-inſtate them.</p>
                  <p>In the two Sieges of <hi>Buda</hi> they had loſt their beſt Troops, and their braveſt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who had put themſelves in a ſtate of periſhing, or were effectually dead with their Arms in their Hands, rather than to abandon this Place to the Chriſtians. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, one ſaw amongſt the Turks none but ſuch Officers as were equally unable to defend and attack with Honour.</p>
                  <p>The hopes of <hi>Teckely,</hi> and thoſe who had remain'd fix'd to his Intereſts, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the ſame time; and having no Troops in his Dependence, nor being able to obtain any of the Turks, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reduced to make uſe of ſome Intrigues, the ſucceſs of which was not advantagious to him. It is ſaid that the Princeſs <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski</hi> ſent the Counteſs <hi>Nadaſti,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hungarian Lady to <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> with a deſign to gain ſome Perſons there, under pretence of being willing to ſubmit to the Emperor. But their Intention was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and they were apprehended, whether what was aſſerted of them was true, or that they were uſed ſo out of Suſpicion, or
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110070:132"/>Revenge. A Turkiſh Party that was to ſurpriſe <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> was defeated by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals <hi>Caraffa</hi> and <hi>Heuſler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is alſo aſſured, that the Princeſs <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski</hi> ſent two Perſons to <hi>Caraffa,</hi> in order to let him know that ſhe was abſolutely diſpoſed to enter into ſome Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Emperor, and demanded for that end a Truce for three Months. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raffa</hi> referr'd her to the Emperor's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, leſt if it proved a Feint, they ſhould tax him with Imprudence in ſuffering himſelf to be impos'd on. As the Affairs of the Turks every day grew worſe, they nearly obſerved the Perſon of <hi>Teckely,</hi> leſt by a Diſguſt of them he would no longer ſerve them, and ſhould apply himſelf to make a ſerious Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with the Emperor. It was for this reaſon they denied him the Liberty of throwing himſelf into <hi>Mongatz,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he promiſed to diſturb the Imperial Troops from thence.</p>

                  <p>Whilſt the Imperialiſts and Turks made great Preparations for the following Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, the Gariſon of <hi>Mongatz,</hi> ſeeing the Emperor diſpoſed to treat the Remainders of the Male-contents with Severity, did all the Waſte they could in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to deprive the Imperialiſts of the means of Subſiſtance; and took away as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110070:133"/>much as they could carry off, and as they judged convenient to ſupport a Siege. The Princeſs <hi>Ragotski</hi> is even accuſed of having directed the Hands of two Priſoners of War to be cut off, and ſent them back in this Condition, bidding them hereafter go and ſerve the Emperor. Being in ſo weak a State as ſhe was, if ſhe uſed them thus, ſhe muſt have particular Reaſons for it; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhe ought to have feared, leſt the Imperialiſts ſhould entertain thoſe Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſo, whom they ſhould have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Teckely</hi> being in the Neighbourhood, without having wherewithal to attempt any thing by force, the Imperialiſts were perſwaded that it was impoſſible for him to remain in Peace. It was imagined, that he ſought Opportunities again of cauſing an Inſurrection in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-Hungary,</hi> and that he held great Intelligences there. As the German Troops miſuſed the Hungarians more than they had ever done, regarding <hi>Hungary</hi> hereafter, as a Land of Conqueſt; the Commanders might eaſily conjecture, that the Hungarians were not leſs incenſed againſt them than before, altho they did not ſhew it, for fear of drawing upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome Diſturbance. Poſſibly this Conduct of the Germans, which reduced to deſpair ſeveral Hungarian Families, who were no eaſier under the Emperor, than
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:110070:133"/>when they bore Arms againſt him, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſome of them to a ſecret Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with their ancient Captain. Perhaps alſo, that as thoſe are never abſolutely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, who have made ſome figure in a rebellious Party, notwithſtanding their ſubmiſſion, eſpecially if they have Eſtates; ſo an Occaſion was look'd after to deſtroy the ancient Friends of <hi>Teckely,</hi> and to ſeize upon what they had, by accuſing them of Treaſon. In the Month of <hi>February,</hi> were arreſted all thoſe who were ſuſpected to have any Intelligence with this Count; and no Hungarian was permitted to leave any Towns, where it was conjectured he had any Correſpondence, without Security. A little while after it was found, that the Conſpiracy had been almoſt univerſal; and that ſeveral of the chief Inhabitants, not only of <hi>Caſſovia</hi> and <hi>Eperies,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Tirnaw, Altſol, Newſol, Leutſch, Oedem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and <hi>Presburgh,</hi> were concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The Priſons were filled with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Perſons, and the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in <hi>Hungary.</hi> They put to Death the greateſt Offenders, or the moſt Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; and the reſt were diſcharged upon the Payment of Fines, which abſolutely ruined them. The ancient Formalities were no more obſerved, than Perſons dared to demand them, for fear of paſſing for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. Count <hi>Caraffa,</hi> and a Chamber com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:110070:134"/>of Strangers, and eſtabliſhed at <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovia,</hi> put a great number to the Rack, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſlender Proofs, which ſo ſeverely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, that ſome died thereof. Theſe extorted Confeſſions, which were given out as they would themſelves; gave the Judges an Opportunity of ſeizing upon what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd to the Hungarians, after the firſt Conſpiracy. If the Hungarians repented of having ſo ſoon ſubmitted to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and had renewed their ancient Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; it muſt be confeſſed, that either the Yoke, which was impoſed on them, was very ſevere, ſince they choſe rather to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a deſperate Party, than to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eternally ſubjected thereto: or that they were extreamly inconſtant, ſince they were uneaſy in all Conditions.</p>
                  <p>The Turks could not get together Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Troops ſufficient to give them a proſpect of re-eſtabliſhing ſoon their Affairs in <hi>Hungary,</hi> as it appeared enough by the Campagne of the following Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The Imperialiſts even publiſhed, that the Viſier had wrote a Letter to Prince <hi>Herman</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> Preſident of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, to demand a Peace of the Emperor. He made him apprehend, 'twas ſaid, that the Sultan his Maſter being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to make a Peace, if the Emperor was in the ſame Diſpoſition, as it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he would, conſidering the ruine of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:110070:134"/>the People, that a Place be agreed upon, where Perſons ſhould be ſent on each ſide to form the Articles: and to make the Sincerity of the Port appear, as ſoon as the Council of <hi>Vienna</hi> ſhould give its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role to enter into a Treaty, the Count of <hi>Teckely</hi> ſhould be given up to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. The Turks deputed likewiſe an Aga to <hi>Debrezen,</hi> who was conducted to <hi>Eperies,</hi> where he demanded a Paſs-Port for an Ambaſſador; but the Emperor made Anſwer to him by <hi>Caraffa,</hi> that he would make a Peace if the Grand Signor would oblige himſelf to pay him ſix Millions of Gold for the Expences of the War, and for the Deſtructions that had been made, and if he would reſtore him all the Places he poſſeſſed in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and would alſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy <hi>Poland</hi> and the Republick of <hi>Venice.</hi> As for what relates to the Offer, which the Turks made of delivering up <hi>Teckely,</hi> it was anſwered that he was eſteemed too little formidable to give Diſturbance to the Emperor, and that a Motive of that nature was not capable of advancing the Peace. If it be true, that the Turks made this Offer, <hi>Teckely</hi> had an occaſion to fear; and if ſuch an Anſwer was given them, as was declared, certainly it was not proper to angment that Eſteem which the Turks had for him. He was at this time in <hi>Lippa,</hi> and he eſcaped an eminent Danger; for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110070:135"/>the Gariſon of <hi>Chenod</hi> having ſurpriſed the City of <hi>Lippa,</hi> he had much ado to ſecure himſelf in the Caſtle. During all this Winter the Imperialiſts made great Incurſions; and if they did not all ſucceed, they had notwithſtanding generally the upper hand.</p>
                  <p>The Viſier made a Review of his Army about the end of <hi>April,</hi> in the Plain of <hi>Salankemen,</hi> near <hi>Belgrade;</hi> it was near 50000 ſtrong. <hi>Teckely</hi> had orders to go to him; and as he was upon his way with 2 or 300 Horſe, he was attack'd near <hi>Giula,</hi> by 500 Huſſars, who killed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 100 Men; but as for him, he retired to <hi>Kerek</hi> during the Fight. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>June,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe took the Field with part of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Army, which was to conſiſt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 50000 Men, and took his March by the <hi>Drave</hi> towards the Bridg of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> which the Turks had not as yet abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repaired, ſince ſome Imperial Detatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had burnt down a part of it. The 26th of <hi>June</hi> he ſet upon them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them to repaſs the <hi>Drave</hi> upon a Bridg of Boats, which they had, altho they had made a Fort at the Head of their Bridg, which the over-flowing of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver broke at the ſame time. This very over-flowing hindred the Imperialiſts from attempting to paſs it during ſome days;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:110070:135"/>but they found means to ſurmount all Difficulties, and the Army paſſed near the Fort of <hi>Siclos</hi> the 11th and 12th of <hi>July,</hi> and was joined four days after by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who commanded the reſt of the Troops, and had croſs'd the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Mohats.</hi> They continued to march towards the Enemy, and arrived at their Trenches the 19th. The Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Army was obliged to break through ſome Defiles which the Enemy guarded, but not without loſs; and the Turks were found after that ſo well poſted, that there was a neceſſity of enduring all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, in order to approach their. Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. They loſt in this occaſion 7 or 800 Men; and after having attempted to draw the Turks out of ſo advantagious a Poſt, the Generals of the Emperor judged it moſt convenient to retire; which they did in good order. The Turks ſent ſome Horſe to charge the Rear, but they were repulſed ſo well, that the Chriſtian Army repaſſed the <hi>Drave</hi> without loſs. The Viſier alſo paſs'd it, and poſted himſelf between <hi>Eſſeck</hi> and <hi>Darda,</hi> in the Iſles which the Marſhes and Arms of this River compoſe there, where it was not poſſible to force him. The Chriſtian Army was near <hi>Mohats,</hi> and made ſeveral unſucceſsful Motions, to draw the Enemies to a Fight, but there were only ſome inconſiderable Skirmiſhes for a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:110070:136"/>long time. C. <hi>Teckely</hi> was then in the Camp of the Turks, and part of their Conduct is imputed to his good Advice. The 12th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Chriſtian Army, in marching from <hi>Mohats</hi> towards <hi>Siclos,</hi> was charged at laſt by the whole Turkiſh Army; but the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who was the firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd, ſuſtained their Shock with ſo much Reſolution, that the whole Chriſtian Army being come back, repulſed them every where; inſomuch that, Terror being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced amongſt them, they fled towards <hi>Eſſeck.</hi> The Bridg of the <hi>Drave</hi> being broke down by thoſe who fled firſt, many of them were drowned who undertook to ſwim over it; and the Turks loſt 6000 Men in this Engagement for want of knowing how to make an orderly Retreat to their Camp, which it was eaſy to defend. But when they have once the lower-hand, their Minds are, for the moſt part, ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed with Fear, that they no longer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh what they do. Otherwiſe they had gain'd the Advantage in the firſt Skirmiſhes, and even in the beginning of the Fight the Ground was favourable to them; and they were ſuperiour to the Chriſtians in number, their Army having been conſiderably ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, ſince it had been ſaid they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 50000 Men. The Chriſtians plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Camp, which they had deſerted, and found therein a very conſiderable booty.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:110070:136"/>
                  <p>After that, the D. of <hi>Lorrain</hi> judging that the Grand-Viſier was not in a condition of undertaking any thing during the reſt of the Campaign, left the C. of <hi>Dunewald,</hi> with 4000 Horſe and 6000 Foot, to cover <hi>Siclos</hi> and <hi>Quinque-Eccleſia;</hi> and paſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> with the remainder of the Army, near <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hats.</hi> From thence he marched towards <hi>Zol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> where having taken to the right, he turned towards <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> to put his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there in Winter-quarters. The War had ſo entirely ruined <hi>Hungary,</hi> that the Towns were almoſt become Deſarts, and the Lands, by conſequence, untilled for the moſt part; which made the Germans, who had been formerly ſo ambitious of Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters in this Country, no longer cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in that reſpect. On the other-ſide, it was to be feared leſt, if <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> were left to the Diſcretion of the Turks, they ſhould take Quarters in't themſelves, and compel <hi>Abaffi</hi> to do for them what he had lately done for the Emperor. At the ſame time, C. <hi>Dunewald</hi> took in the <hi>Lower-Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Butzin, Walpo, Eſſeck,</hi> which the Turks abandoned in diſorder, and <hi>Peter-Waradin,</hi> which compleated a Confuſion in all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Turks, and filled the Imepria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts with Courage; who obſerving that to ſucceed, they had nothing more to do than to undertake, performed things every day, which formerly they durſt not ſo much as think on.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:110070:137"/>
                  <p>It was then the Emperor, who had a mind to Crown the Arch-duke <hi>Joſeph,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſent for the chief Lords of this Kingdom to <hi>Vienna.</hi> He reſtored to them the Crown, which he had transferred from <hi>Presburgh</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with him during the War. This Prince made them a Diſcourſe in Latin, wherein he told them, amongſt other things, that he depoſited the Crown with them, in order to ſee it ſuddenly upon the Head of his Son, whom it was time to declare hereditary K. of <hi>Hungary.</hi> The Hungarians returned Thanks to the Emperor in the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſent the Crown to <hi>Presburgh;</hi> but it was not ſet upon the Head of the Arch-duke, till about the end of the Year, as ſhall be ſeen in the Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>The evil Conduct of the Grand-Viſier, followed with the ill Succeſſes of this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, excited great Murmurings in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which beſides wanted the Pay of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Months. The Tumult went ſo far, that the Army, refuſing to obey him, advanced to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where it went to demand his Head, and thoſe of ſeveral Officers, — of the Grand-Signor. The Viſier of his own Accord ſurrendred his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which was given to <hi>Siaous,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Wiſhes of part of the Army; but this Reſignation could not ſave his Life. The Caimacan, with ſome others, were alſo
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:110070:137"/>put to Death. Methinks the Army ſhould have been contented with this Sacrifice; but the exceſſive Expences of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the 4th, and his ſlothful, effeminate Life, ruined e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himſelf. The troubleſome Fellows de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him alſo in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> and placed upon the Throne his Brother <hi>Solyman,</hi> the Third of the Name, who is not more expert, or more couragious, than his eldeſt Brother. But as when one is not ſatisfied with the Condition one is in, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeems to be likely to improve with change; they did not ceaſe to perſwade themſelves that all would go better under his Government, than under that of the depoſed Sultan; who was impriſoned, as his Succeſſor had been for ſeveral Years.</p>
                  <p>To return to what paſs'd in <hi>Hungary;</hi> the D. of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſent word into <hi>Tranſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> that to protect this Country from the Undertakings of the Infidels, the Emperor had found it neceſſary to put Gariſons into the chief Places, and to give Winter-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his Army there; which the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvanians would doubtleſs approve of, ſince it concerned their Deliverance from the Yoke of the Infidels. The Tranſilvanians, who had at leaſt as much Liberty under the Protection of the Turks, as they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect under the Emperor, were afraid of changing their Maſter; for it was of no leſs import. <hi>Abaffi</hi> in particular, who had
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:110070:138"/>aſſiſted the Male-contents, and the Turks, by whom he had been made Vaivod, as it has been elſewhere ſaid,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the Apprehenſion of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the Emperor's hands, who had oppoſed his Eſtabliſhment as much as poſſibly he could. He repented that he had been a Spectator only, for the laſt years, of the Differences betwixt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and the Male-contents, whom he ſhould, according to good Policy, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to aſſiſt with all his Force, ſince he could but periſh, or ſave himſelf with them. But theſe Reflections were unſeaſonable now; whereupon, the Imperial Army was adviſed from the part of the Tranſilvani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that they would furniſh it with as much Proviſions as they poſſibly could; but as for ſurrendring their Places, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Quarters, they could not do it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing themſelves to the Revenge of the Turks and Tartars; who entring into ſuch an open Country as theirs, would lead off, without any hopes of Prevention, the greateſt part of its Inhabitants into Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and carry Deſolation every-where.</p>
                  <p>The D. of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having anſwered to that in general Terms, aſſuring them of the Protection of the Emperor, did not ceaſe to continue his Advancing into the Country; and fixed a Gariſon at <hi>Sabelona,</hi> upon the 11th of <hi>October,</hi> when he arrived
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:110070:138"/>there. The Tranſilvanians might repeat their Offers long enough; he marched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Clauſemburgh,</hi> where he entred the 20th, upon condition that he ſhould leave all things in the ſtate he found them; that he ſhould exact no Contributions; that the Magiſtrates ſhould be exempted from entertaining Souldiers; that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens ſhould be obliged only to furniſh the Imperial Gariſon with Neceſſaries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being obliged to convert them into Money; and that the Troops ſhould be kept under a ſevere Diſcipline. He did the ſame in reſpect of <hi>Tuttemburgh, Alba-Julia, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtad,</hi> and others of the moſt important Places. There was alſo a particular Treaty with <hi>Abaffi</hi> and the States; wherein they alſo covenanted, that there ſhould be no Revolution amongſt them, and that the Troops ſhould depart the following Spring, and they would be obliged to furniſh them with a certain quantity of Proviſions. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baffi</hi> and his Family, who were at <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtad,</hi> retired to <hi>Fogarats;</hi> a Place that properly belonged to him; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with an abſolute Liberty of paſſing to and fro through <hi>Tranſilvania.</hi> The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts obliged themſelves alſo to defend them, againſt all Powers whatſoever, and to make no enquiry after paſt Affairs. Which done, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> took his way to <hi>Presburgh,</hi> in order to be preſent
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:110070:139"/>at the Coronation of the Arch-duke.</p>
                  <p>If any thing had been capable of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Teckely,</hi> and if one could rejoice at the Misfortunes of old Friends, he would have felt ſome Conſolation at the Reception of this News; becauſe in vainly importuning the Tranſilvanians to afford him ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, he had foretold them more than once, that what at this time happened to them, would not fail to make them remember him, when it would be too late. He had likewiſe given the ſame Admonitions to thoſe Hungarians, whom his Confinement induced to accept the General Pardon; and he then ſaw them become the Prey of Strangers, without being in a condition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſhake off that Yoke, which they had apprehended ſo many years.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor and the Arch-duke being arrived, with all their Court, at <hi>Presburgh,</hi> upon the 30th of <hi>October,</hi> where the States were aſſembled, the Emperor told them in Latin what he deſired of them, and alſo gave it them in Writing. It directed, that his Son might not only be crowned King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> but alſo that the Kingdom be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared hereditary in his Family. The States examined this Propoſition in ſeveral Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; wherein they renewed the greateſt part of thoſe Complaints, which the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians had uſed to make; after which ſome Articles were drawn up, which were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:110070:139"/>preſented to the Emperor by the Deputies of the Diet. Altho they did not refuſe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Arch-duke <hi>Joſeph,</hi> they demanded the Enjoyment of their ancient Liberty, without ſpeaking of an hereditary Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: That after a Peace ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with the Port, all the German Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons might be recalled, and Hungarians put in their room, to guard Places. In a word, that all their Grievances, which they had not yet drawn up, might be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and rectified before the Coronation.</p>
                  <p>The States had 14 days allowed them to prepare and bring in theſe Grievances; and in the mean time, it was declared to them, that the Expences, which the Emperor had made in order to defend <hi>Hungary</hi> againſt the Turks, which amounted to much more than the Value of the Kingdom, gave him a Right to look upon it as his other heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Dominions.</p>
                  <p>It was much conteſted thereupon in the Aſſembly; and ſome Hiſtorians ſay,<note place="margin">Greg. Leti. Hiſt. dell. Imper. <hi>p. 370.</hi>
                     </note> that the Count <hi>Nic. Draſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cowits,</hi> Great Arbitrator of the Kingdom, having ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Conſequences of ſurrendring a Right of this nature, they pray'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to make no Alteration in their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms; but that the Emperor ſent them word again, that his Predeceſſors and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf having purchaſed <hi>Hungary</hi> at ſo dear
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:110070:140"/>a rate, it was but reaſonable for the Crown to become hereditary in their Houſe. Some days after, as this matter ſtill took up the States, <hi>Draſcowits</hi> being dead ſuddenly at night in his Bed, without any one's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well the Cauſe; thoſe, who had been of the ſame Opinion with him, were in ſuch a Conſternation at his Death, poſſibly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural at the ſame time, that no body any longer openly oppoſed the Emperor's Will. Some pretended only, to preſerve a part of their ancient Rights, that if there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> the States ought to have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of electing which they pleaſed. But this Overture having been alſo rejected, the States were at length reduced to declare, that for the future the Kingdom of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ſhould be hereditary in the Auſtrian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Imperial Branch; that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of Heirs Males, it ſhould paſs to the Females; and in default of both, it ſhould firſt belong to the Princes, and then the Princeſſes of the Branch of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that; there remain'd nothing more but the Ceremony of the Coronation, which was expected to be performed before the end of <hi>November;</hi> but it was deferred to the 9th of the following Month; for that all the Preparations were not made, and beſides it was neceſſary to determine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Matters in the Aſſembly of the States;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:110070:140"/>of which the two principal are theſe: The firſt is, that purſuant to an Article of the Declaration of King <hi>Andrew,</hi> each of the three States had a Right to oppoſe the King, when he contravened the Laws of the Kingdom, without being reputed Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders for not ſubmitting to his Orders. The Emperor apprehended that his Son and his Succeſſors were not obliged to ſwear to this Article, becauſe it had always been, ſaid he, a Bottom for Seditions, which the Rebels had even made uſe of within ſome few Years. But on the other ſide, the States in relaxing thereupon, not only rendred the King abſolute Maſter of the Goods and Lives of the Hungarians, but alſo ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by a publick Act, to all his Caprices, or rather to thoſe of his Miniſters and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites. For it is certain, that thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are no leſs abſolute than Kings; and 'tis this, that makes them diſpoſe Princes to ſeek ſo greedily after a Deſpotick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wherein they are ſo much concerned. The moſt part of the Grandees were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to agree to what the Emperor thought fit; becauſe they hoped to enjoy a part of the Regal Power, in exerciſing the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, according to his Intentions; but the Clergy and the Cities, who had no ſuch Bottoms, and who ſaw themſelves thereby ſubjected to all ſorts of Inconveniences, without the leaſt Remedy, inſiſted much
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110070:141"/>upon it, and demanded Satisfaction upon their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. They had preſented a looſe Sheet to the Emperor; in which they made a Particular of the Cruelties which had been practiſed againſt ſeveral Perſons of Note, and a great number of others of leſs Quality, under pretence of ſearching the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices of a Conſpiracy, wherein they were not at all concerned. He did not refuſe to give them Juſtice thereupon, nor to put their Reaſons under Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but they muſt ſuffer it to be deferred till the Coronation was over, becauſe too great a time was requiſite for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Affair related to the Evangelicks, or Proteſtants. To make their Court, they had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to get the Crown of <hi>Hungary</hi> declared heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and imagined that the Occaſion was favourable to petition the Emperor in particular, that he would maintain them in their ancient Privileges; That their Temples and Eſtates might be reſtored to them, which they had been diſpoſſeſſed of ſince the Year 1667; That there might be no Aſſembly for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Kingdom, without-ſome Deputies on their part; That the Jeſuits might be prohibited from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with State-Affairs, or concerning the Proteſtant Religion; That they might not be permitted to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh themſelves in any other Places than where they were; That <hi>Caraffa</hi> might be ſuddenly recalled, who was accuſed of having put to Death an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People, who had no ſhare in the Conſpiracy. It was conſidered in the States, whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants might be permitted to ask theſe Favours of the Emperor, but it was found that the Seaſon could hardly favour their Purpoſe. So that was alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till the Coronation was over; which impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Imperial Council did what it judged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, without the King of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s holding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to any thing. The Ceremony of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation then was performed the 9th, as it had Seen reſolved; but the Particulars are not to be inſiſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Whilſt great Rejoycings were made at <hi>Presburgh,</hi> there arrived a Courier with a new Subject of Joy; to wit, the News of the Reduction of <hi>Agria,</hi> which for want of Proviſions, ſurrendred upon Capitulation the 28th of <hi>November;</hi> ſo that there remain'd nothing but <hi>Mongats</hi> unſubjected to the Emperor in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Then to give ſome Satisfaction to the Hungarians, he aboliſhed the Criminal-Chamber of <hi>Eperies,</hi> ſet up to ſearch after thoſe who had been concerned in the late Conſpiracy; and which had put to Death a world of People, without obſerving the uſual Proceedings. As to what regards the quartering of Troops, and their Entertainment; whereas the German Officers had diſpoſed of it as they thought fit, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the Hungarians; Commiſſioners were nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of this Nation, who were to regulate thoſe kind of things jointly with the Germans. The Examination of the reſt was referred to another Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants did alſo beg of the Emperor, and the King, by a Requeſt, that <hi>Hungary</hi> might be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in reſpect of Religion, to the State it was in when his Imperial Majeſty came to the Crown. It was repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, that there required time to conſider of a thing of that conſequence; and that in the mean time, they might aſſure themſelves of the Favour of the Emperor and King, provided they continued in their Fidelity to them. All they could obtain, was, that things ſhould be eſtabliſhed as they were in 1681.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary</hi> from elective, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hereditary; and inſtead of a moderate Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the Laws, the States have ſuffered <hi>Joſeph</hi> the 1ſt, to take one almoſt without Bounds. All the Projects which the Hungarians had ſo often made for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Liberty, all the Preparations in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> during ſo many years, for that Deſign, yielded at laſt to the good Fortune of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> for whom <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> re-united, conquered King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, without the Aſſiſtance of one Prince of its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ood, and for whom Fortune, if it is permitted to ſay
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:110070:142"/>ſo, took Cities, whilſt thoſe Princes were aſleep.</p>
                  <p>On another ſide; almoſt all that <hi>Teckely</hi> undertook, was baffled. He had formed a Deſign upon <hi>Seged,</hi> which the taking of <hi>Agria</hi> ruined entirely. He might write long enough to all thoſe, whom he knew in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> in order to inſpire them with a new Courage; no Body was moved, and Liberty was nothing but a fine Name, fit to draw Sighs from the beſt-intention'd, but incapable of raiſing them to Arms. The Turks, imbroil'd amongſt themſelves, did not diſtinguiſh what they did, nor granted him that Relief which they had promiſed him. All that he could do with 5 or 6000 Men, was to make Incurſions upon thoſe Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who had ſubmitted to the Emperor. He attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral times to get near <hi>Mongats,</hi> or to throw himſelf therein, and to put ſome Relief in it, or to bring out his Wife; but they had lately block'd up the Place with more Application than ever, inſomuch that all his Efforts were unſeaſonable. The Princeſs, being ſummoned to ſurrender, did not refuſe to enter into a Negotiation; but no concluſion could be made, becauſe ſhe inſiſted upon having her Husband and his Companions, included in it, which the Emperor abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed her. Notwithſtanding, he had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs about this time, to detach from the Gariſon of <hi>Seged</hi> 400 Hungarians, and 400 others, who went in a Party about <hi>Lippa.</hi> The Hungarian Troops, mortified by the great Advantages which the Germans had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without them, had much ado to live with them; and ſome of the moſt impatient, rather choſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo once more the hazard of periſhing with their ancient. Captain, than to ſee themſelves miſuſed by Strangers in their own Countrey.</p>

                  <p>THe Affairs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire being in a very great diſorder, and the new Sultan, no more than his Vizier, not knowing how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf to hinder the <hi>Germans</hi> from making new Conqueſts in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the <hi>Divan</hi> thought it was neceſſary to know the opinion of the <hi>Baſſa's,</hi> who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110070:143"/>were not able to come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to ſend, in the ſame time, for all the Officers of experience that were in the extend of that Empire. Orders were ſent to <hi>Teckely</hi> too, to repair thither, that they might hear of him, what he thought the moſt effectual Method to carry on the War in <hi>Hungary.</hi> Altho' there was a great deal of danger for him to obey that Order, becauſe it might happen that the <hi>Turks</hi> being irritated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that had engaged them in that War, would revenge themſelves upon him for the loſſes they had made; nevertheleſs he took the reſolution to go, to repreſent to his Highneſs more ſtrongly than he could do by Letters, what it behoved them to do in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of ſuch a conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Before he ſet forth for his journey, he wrote to his Spouſe to take patience ſtill for a while, ſeeing that as ſoon as he would come back he would not fail to go to her Succour.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, whatever the <hi>Princeſs</hi> could do, ſhe was not able to perſuade the Garriſon to hold any longer; becauſe a Month before that time it was reduced to ſuch a want, as was capable to put the the moſt Conſtant out of Patience. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard, beſides, that <hi>Teckely</hi> was gone
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110070:143"/>to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſhe thought him to be abſolutly loſt. And indeed the leaſt fit of Inconſtancy, whether in the Grand Seignior, or in the Vizier, was enough to Reſtroy him. Thoſe Reaſons brought the <hi>Princeſs</hi> and the Garriſon of <hi>Mongatz</hi> to capitulate the 17th of <hi>January.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are the chiefeſt Articles, which ſhe agreed upon with <hi>Caraffa,</hi> authorized by the Emperour: 1. <q>That a general Pardon ſhould be granted to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, as well as to the Inhabitants, for all that was paſt; and that ſhe ſhould carry along with her all that ſhe had in the Place. 2. That the <hi>Princeſs Ragots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki,</hi> and the Children ſhe had by the <hi>Prince Ragotski,</hi> ſhould be brought to <hi>Vienna</hi> at the Emperor's charge, who ſhould keep them, according to their Quality, and that he ſhould let them enjoy all ſort of Liberty, excepted that they could not go out of it without his leave. 3. 'That all the Goods, moveable, and immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that could be found belonging to them in <hi>Mongatz,</hi> and elſewhere, ſhould be reſtored to them; but that that place and what belongs to it, ſhould remain in the Emperor's hands, till they had made it appear that it had not been uſurped upon the Crown of <hi>Hungary.</hi> 4. 'That the <hi>Princeſs</hi> ſhould enjoy all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110070:144"/>the Benefits ſhe had received of <hi>Prince Ragotski,</hi> when he eſpouſed her, unleſs the Emperour thought convenient to give her an equal Value, and that ſhe could take all that belonged to her in particular in <hi>Mongatz;</hi> but that all the States of her Children, and their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould be left to the Emperour, and that he ſhould be their Guardian. 5. That ſhe ſhould be bound to reſtore upon Oath all that belonged to Count <hi>Teckely,</hi> and them who were ſtill with him. 6. That the Emperour ſhould take care to have her Children brought up as he would think the moſt convenient. 7. That the <hi>Princeſs</hi> ſhould not acquaint <hi>Teckely</hi> of the ſurrender of the place, nor of the Reaſons why ſhe had done it. 8. That leave ſhould be granted her to tarry in it, till ſhe had ſetled her Affairs, and the Equipage that was to carry her to <hi>Vienna</hi> ſhould be ready.</q> Two days after the concluſion of this Treaty the place was ſurrendred into the hands of the Imperialiſts, altho' the <hi>Princeſs</hi> did not go out of it preſently after, for the reaſons we have ſaid already. They ſay ſhe boreher ill Fortune with great Conſtancy, and that ſhe hath never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed any ſign of Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, it happened a thing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110070:144"/>that might have ſerved mightily to re-eſtabliſh the Affairs of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and of the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> if the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſerved themſelves of the occaſion, as they ſhould have done: It was, that the Troops the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had left in <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi> inſtead of obſerving the Treaty that had been made, committed infinite Diſorders, and lived as they pleaſed upon free Quarters, by reaſon they were not paid, according to their ancient Cuſtom. It may be too that the Imperial Court was not ſorry that its Troops would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it ſelf, becauſe <hi>Abaffi</hi> had aſſiſted the <hi>Malecontents</hi> during many years; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he deſerved as much, for having done too little ſince he ſided with that Party, and too much to be regarded as a Friend by the Emperour. The <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvanians</hi> ſent to <hi>Vienna</hi> to complain of the Ravages the Imperial Troops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their Country, and to repreſent, that if the Treaty was not kept by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Party; it would not be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither by themſelves. Upon thoſe Complaints, <hi>Caraffa</hi> received order to go into <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> where inſtead of ſatisfying the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> by a good Diſcipline, he complained by turns, as if they had failed to execute ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Treaty. Thus the <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanians</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:110070:145"/>found themſelves more grieved by that General's coming than they were before. And yet to ſhow that he was willing to give them ſome Satisfaction, he offered to eaſe them in removing thoſe Soldiers Quarters, provided they would pay ſome certain Sum of Money to the Emperour; but that Sum was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive that it was impoſſible it could be found in <hi>Tranſilvania.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A little while after the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſent a Chioux to <hi>Abaffi,</hi> to ſolicite him to brake the Treaty he had made with the Emperour, upon the Word he gave him to ſuccour him the next Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. But becauſe all theſe were but words, and that the ill Succeſs of the Campaigns that were paſt, gave little hopes to ſee the Effects of it, <hi>Abafti</hi> had rather carry himſelf diſcreetly, and keep fair with the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who was able to puniſh him for his Inconſtancy. Nevertheleſs, the carriage of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Army was ſuch that it hindered the Hoſpodar of <hi>Walaenia,</hi> ſollicited by the Emperour to ſide with him openly, from falling into that Snare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Teckely,</hi> who was in his way for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> did not go very far, thinking that his Remoteneſs would caſt all them that remained ſtill his Friends into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110070:145"/>and that after the taking of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatz</hi> his Preſence was abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: When therefore he had joyned his Troops, it wanted very little but he had been ſurprized hard by <hi>Waradin</hi> by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Heuſler,</hi> who ſet upon him unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: but having retired himſelf ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to <hi>Giula</hi> with his Horſe, he avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Danger, and his Foot was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defeated. Some of his Enemies that were then at the Port, made their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, at that time, to ruine him by reaſon of his Abſence; going about to perſwade, That in betraying the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Grand Seignour, he durſt not come up to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> after having given his word that he would come. But thoſe Accuſations appeared ſo ill grounded, and thoſe who were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the condition <hi>Hungary</hi> was then in, knew ſo evidently the contrary, that they had no effect at all. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Sultan ſent to him to aſſure him of his Protection, and to confirm upon him the Title of <hi>Prince of Hungary,</hi> which <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Fourth had given him: he preſented him in the ſame time with a Semiter inriched with precious Stones, and exhorted him to make uſe of it againſt his Enemies, with the ſame Faithfulneſs he had done till then. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110070:146"/>there was a Report that he had been ſtrangled by the order of the Port; and to undeceive them who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended him ſtill, he cauſed this <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto</hi> to be publiſhed:</p>

                              <p>YE People of <hi>Hungary,</hi> it is long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſince your Enemies and mine have publiſhed my Death; and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I am alive ſtill, God be thanked, to defend your oppreſſed Liberty. I know it is to your ſorrow, that you follow for the preſent the Standards of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> it is too long ago ſince you know it, to truſt yourſelves to it: And what has lately hapned in the pretended Election of a King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> makes you know plainly how much both your Lives and your Fortunes would be in a Danger, if you were compelled to obey him: Ye are forced to diſſemble, becauſe the conjuncture ye are in will have it ſo; but I know your hearts as I know mine, I know ye have an horrour for all that ye do, and that they hate them that are a preparing their Chains, although they be bound to bear them, by reaſon of the Charges they enjoy in the Kingdom.</p>

                              <p>Is it not a ſhameful thing, for Count <hi>Eſterhaſi,</hi> to have made a private ſuit for the Dignity of Count of the Empire, as if that of Palatine of <hi>Hungary</hi> was not without compariſon much above it? Is that the Reward of all the baſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he has been guilty of againſt you? And is it poſſible that a Man who has the Honour to be in my Alliance<note n="*" place="bottom">His Brother has married Count <hi>Teckely</hi>'s Siſter.</note>, would diſgrace me and all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

Do they not do the ſame ſtill every day, if I were willing to accept them? But if God has reſolved that I ſhould be Vnfortunate, it is not poſſible I ſhould be Guilty; and rather than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray you, I would expoſe myſelf: I drew the Sword for you, as ſoon as I was able to weild it; and I have undergone a thouſand Dangers in your Service: I have contemned Swords and Poiſon, and I am ſtill expoſed every day to both by my Conſtancy to you.

                              <p>But 'tis not time yet to be out of Hopes, ye know that I am under the Protection of a powerful Empire, and that it is ready ſtill to receive you under its Protection: If it has met with ſome Croſſes of Fortune, it is not in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for all that to be overthrown; if it had loſt all that it holds in <hi>Europe,</hi> which it is very far off, yet of it remains ſtill two Parts of the World wherein it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. It had not ſo much of Strenght when it Overthrew the Empire of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and that of the <hi>Weſt</hi> doth not come near to its Power. It is not time then yet to ſay, as they do every day, That there is wanting but a little Strength to run it quite down. Your Enemies and mine are perſwaded of it in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their Hearts: That is the only reaſon why they moderate ſtill the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they are in, to ſpill to the very laſt drop of our Bloud. Do you not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that they have ſhed, without having been provoked, in ſo many Rencounters, and how they have put the Arms in the Executioners hands when theirs were weary of uſing them? Is there any one amongſt you, that may boaſt himſelf, that he has not loſt a Brother, or a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, or a Kinſman, or a Friend in that great Effuſion of Bloud that has been
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110070:147"/>newly made by General <hi>Caraffa?</hi> What is, has been the Succeſs of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, although ye have clearly proved, that he did nothing elſe than to rob the Fatherleſs, and Motherleſs, and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. They have made as if they had ſent ſome Orders that the ſtrict Forms of Proceedings in Law ſhould be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but ye have ſeen whether they have been performed. Since he had received them, we may reckon, you and I, above two hundred Perſons he has condemned by his own Authority; and to whom he has anſwered uncivilly, when they have begged leave to juſtifie themſelves, That their Tryals would be performed after they had been executed.</p>
                              <p>How long will ye bear, ye brave <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians,</hi> their Triumph over your Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency? If you be deſigned to periſh, is it not better to do it having your Arms in your hands, than to be put to death by an infamous Hang-man? Make ſome Endeavours to get out of the ſhameful Slavery wherein you are, ſeeing you want nothing elſe but the Will to do it: The Power of your Enemies is not ſo great as you think. How can it be, ſince I ſcorn it? And if you had helped me with all your Forces, what condition ſhould we have been in? Do not tarry till ye be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110070:148"/>weaker than ye are now. They do not endeavour to weaken you, but to render you abſolutely uncapable of ſhaking off the tyrannical Yoak which they are a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for you ſo many Years ſince.</p>

A Prince of his Name has been formerly the Terrour of thoſe you are dreading now-a-days; and although we muſt not give credit to Propheſies which come from thence, I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear from telling you, that the <hi>Turks</hi> are a divulging, they have one, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which their Empire almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, is to become more flouriſhing than ever, under a Prince of that Name. Do but joyn with me, that it might be found true, ſince your Safety as well as mine depends for ever upon our Vnion with thoſe People: They have ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us during many Years, as we have ſupported them by turns. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acted unanimouſly: Why ſhould we give over a Conduct which has turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much to our good?</p>
                              <p>What can you expect from your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Promiſes? Do but look upon the Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and you will ſee how they have abuſed his Credulity: What good doth he got for having made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110070:148"/>a Treaty with a People that will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a ſingle Article of it? But there is no need to fetch Inſtances from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: How many times have they bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their Word they had given you? Or to ſpeak more proper, Is there any one amongſt you, who can remember that they have kept it to him? They ſeek for no other thing but to engage you into a Treaty, to deceive you the better; and your Faithfulneſs hath not been reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by the blackeſt Treachery.

                  <p>Thoſe Reaſons had very little ſucceſs, they not being backed by any Army cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to give a Shelter to the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who had declared themſelves for <hi>Tecke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Thoſe that favoured him privately, were informed by this Declaration that the <hi>Turks</hi> had not put him to death; but they were not in a capacity to help him otherways than with their Wiſhes and Prayers. Thus he tarried a long while about <hi>Giula</hi> without undertaking any thing. It is reported, that the <hi>Turks</hi> fearing that he being weary at laſt of ſo many Croſſes of Fortune, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile himſelf to the Emperour, got him to be watched ſo near, that he could do nothing but they were acquainted with it. Some great Diſorders happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110070:149"/>a little while after at the Port, where the Chiaoux made a new Vizier, who had brought up <hi>Soliman</hi> upon the Throne, was treacherouſly murthered by the Seditious, and the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior himſelf was in a eminent danger of being Depoſed. He could not get off but by appeaſing the mutiny'd Troops with a great deal of Money, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome of the hotteſt to be ſtrangled: He created Vizier <hi>Iſmal Bacha</hi> in the room of the Chiaoux, and publiſhed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-where, that he would go into <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> at the head of the Armies, or at leaſt to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> to be nearer to them, and readier to ſend them the neceſſary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. It was ordered in the mean while, that all the Preparations ſhould be got ready againſt the next Campaigne.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing they did to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Ragotski,</hi> after her arrival at <hi>Vienna,</hi> was to take away her Children from her, and to get them to be brought up in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, inſtead of the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> wherein they had been inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince their Mother was married to Count <hi>Teckely.</hi> This laſt having had notice they had carried his Wife to <hi>Vienna,</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for to have leave to write to her; which was denied him by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Officers. Notwithſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110070:150"/>it was a hard matter to ſurprize him, what meaſures ſoever they could take; they thought to have found out the means to make him away in corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two of his Troops Officers, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged ſome Souldiers in their Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and who had executed it, had it not been diſcovered: But they having been betrayed by ſome amongſt them, they were all hanged, with a Bill wherein one could read theſe words, <hi>Traytor to his Prince, to his Religion, and Country.</hi> The Army expreſſed a great Joy that that Plot had been diſcovered; and abuſed the very dead Bodies of thoſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Men. A little while after the <hi>Hungarians</hi> of St. <hi>Job</hi>'s Gariſon, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that had been at <hi>Mongatz,</hi> came to ſurrender themſelves to him, becauſe, notwithſtanding the Amniſty, they were uſed very ill at all times, and that the leaſt Fault in them was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Death; they perceived there was no truſting upon the Imperialiſts Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, after having been in Arms againſt them; and that they had forgiven them what was paſt, only till they could find an opportunity to deſtroy them. That Conduct of the Imperialiſts is the cauſe that <hi>Teckely</hi> has not been ſeen yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a little Body of <hi>Hungarians,</hi> become
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110070:150"/>irreconcileable to the <hi>Germans.</hi> He was then upon the Frontiers of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> with eight thouſand Men, and raiſed ſome conſiderable Contributions out of the Neighbourhood in ſpite of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts: Theſe laſt would leave whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> where Count <hi>Caraffa</hi> left four thouſand Men to hinder <hi>Abafti</hi> from making a new Treaty with the Port, that ſollicited him to it a long while. In the mean time he drew towards <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> and a little while after the Garriſon of <hi>Alba-Regalis,</hi> deſtitute of Proviſions and Succours, and without hope of getting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, perſwaded the Baſſa to ſurrender himſelf to ſome <hi>German</hi> Troops that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted the Victuals coming to them many Months, <hi>Teckely</hi> received this news with Sorrow; and the <hi>Turks</hi> fearing leſt he ſhould retire into <hi>Poland,</hi> obliged him to take a new Oath of Fidelity, and gave him new Aſſurances that they would not forſake him. In the Month of <hi>June</hi> he attempted to ſurprize <hi>Chonod,</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, every thing ſeem'd to favour the Imperialiſts, and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being the only Commander of the Army, during the Sickneſs of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> paſſed the <hi>Save</hi> in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> and took <hi>Belgrade</hi> the ſeventh of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110070:151"/>the next Month, altho' they had got ſome Succours into it in the beginning of the Siege. True it is, that that place was not very ſtrong, but there were in it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that remained of the good Troops the <hi>Turks</hi> had in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the <hi>Port</hi> was very much concerned in the keeping of it. The Imperialiſts, having got that Town, were in a condition of plundering every where to the very Gates of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of <hi>Servia, Boſnia,</hi> and <hi>Bulgaria;</hi> becauſe there is no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable place in thoſe Provinces. The Baſſa of <hi>Boſnia</hi> who was a marching with ſome Troops to come to the Relief of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi> not only began his march too late, but beſides he was defeated by Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> who went to encounter him. The Grand Seignior, whom the Seditions had detained at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and who was not able to ſend a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Army into the Field, had ſent, before he had the News of the Siege of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> ſome Envoys to ſpeak of Peace with the Emperor. They arrived im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the taking of that place, and underſtood by that it was ſtill more neceſſary to come to ſome Agreement, which they did not think at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> It is very probable it had been
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110070:151"/>ſoon concluded, if the Emperor had not made exceſſive Demands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and if theſe laſt had not been ſo much the more incouraged as ſoon as they knew that <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th, King of <hi>France,</hi> was at the end of <hi>September</hi> entered into the Territories of the Empire, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared a War againſt the Emperour. That made the next Year a great Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but becauſe that is a thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the general Hiſtory of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire we ſhall not ſtick to it. We ſhall ſay nothing neither of the Enterprize which <hi>William Henry of Naſſan, Prince of Orange,</hi> performed at the end of that Year in <hi>England,</hi> where after he had re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Laws, he was made King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Yet we muſt own that made not a little to hinder the Diverſion, the King of <hi>France</hi> would have made in favour of the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Malecontents</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> from being ſo conſiderable. So that tho' the King of <hi>France</hi> had deſigned to make an happy Uſe of the Pretexts which the Rules of good Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſuggeſted to him,<note place="margin">Terms taken out of the Declaration of War of <hi>France,</hi> dated the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>September, 1688.</hi>
                     </note> to prevent the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Greatneſs of the Emperor; yet he was obliged to turn the beſt part of his Troops againſt <hi>England,</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:110070:152"/>and <hi>Holland,</hi> which hindered him from acting along while againſt the Emperor, with the Forces neceſſary to make him abandon <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Teckely</hi> having had notice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that the <hi>French</hi> Army had attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Empire, did not fail to make it known every-where, and let the People underſtand how the King of <hi>France</hi> was a going to put the Emperour and the Empreſs into ſuch a Confuſion, that the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould ſoon have the upper-hand in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which muſt be quitted by the <hi>Germans,</hi> who would now be forced to defend their own Country. And he made it his endeavour to perſuade the <hi>Hungarians</hi> to take hold of that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to rid themſelves again of the Deſpotical Government of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> But the ſame Reaſons which hindered his Declaration from having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Succeſs, prevented alſo the Effects of this Admonition. The Diverſion <hi>France</hi> was capable of making, was too far off to compell the Imperialiſts ſuddenly to meet it, for they ſuffered <hi>Philipsbourgh, Spire, Worms,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate</hi> to be taken, before they ſent any Troops that way. They acted the reſt of that Year, according to the ſame manner, as if <hi>Germany</hi> had enjoyed a perfect Peace.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110070:152"/>And yet they will have us aſſured, that the little Army of Count <hi>Teckely</hi> was in a better caſe, and better paid than before, altho' the <hi>Turks</hi> did not then ſupply them, as 'twas reported, with any Money, which cauſed the People to have ſome ſuſpicion, that the ſame Power that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the Empire upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> did furniſh them with what they wanted, by ſending their Leader ſecretly Bills of Exchange.</p>
                  <p>Whether it was true, or no, <hi>Teckely</hi> was a making endeavours to encourage the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and to perſwade the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> and <hi>Walaquians</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and deliver themſelves from the Yoke of the <hi>Germans.</hi> The Emperor had already concluded a Treaty with the Hoſpodar of <hi>Walaquia,</hi> but that Treaty became fruitleſs by the death of this laſt; which gave Count <hi>Teckely</hi> ſome hopes to have good ſucceſs on that ſide. It was thought the Son of the Hoſpodar ſhould ſucceed his Father, but the States elected their Chancellor, by reaſon of the neceſſity of the preſent juncture of Affairs, which required an able Man for the Management of their Affairs. The Emperor having had notice of it, thought it neceſſary to lay hold of the wavering condition People are always in at the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110070:153"/>beginning of a Principality; and made as if he had been willing to ſupport the Son of the Deceaſed, unleſs the new Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpodar would declare himſelf for him: That Prince, leſt he ſhould incur the Hatred of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in forſaking them openly, and to carry himſelf diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and keep fair with the Emperour, gave out, He was ready to enter into a.

                  <p>In the mean while <hi>Mauro Cordato,</hi> firſt Interpreter and <hi>Effendi,</hi> whom the <hi>Port</hi> had ſent to the Emperor, and who had not been willing to open themſelves to any Body but himſelf, offered to leave him the Conqueſts he had made in <hi>Hungary,</hi> if he would conclude a Peace. But they laughed at that Propoſal, becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> offered only what they muſt loſe; they pretended they ſhould quit to the Emperor all that they kept ſtill in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> and they ſhould go out of <hi>Boſnia, Servia</hi> and <hi>Slavonia,</hi> demanding beſides ſome great Sums of Money, thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces being not capable, ſaid they, to make amends for the charges of the War. All the Offers of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeemed too ſmall matter to the Victorious Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, the Demands of the Imperialiſts were looked upon by the <hi>Port</hi> to be exceſſive, ſo that that Embaſſy was quite in vain; the Envoys having had no other order than to propoſe the yielding up of what the Emperor had gotten, nor having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any ſince, ſo that after having kept ſome Years, ſtrictly enough, they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110070:154"/>have been forced to let them go.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Vizier not perceiving any Succeſs of the Embaſſy, went about to prepare himſelf for the War, and got the moſt, he could, of the Troops out of <hi>Aſia.</hi> The Grand Seignior was much ſtreightned for want of Money, and they did not know how to raiſe ſome ſpeedily, becauſe they durſt not gather the Taxes with too much violence, leaſt new Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould ariſe, which they had been too much uſed to, ſince the Elevation of <hi>Soliman</hi> upon the Throne. That is the fate of the Deſpotical Empire, they are not to lay heavy Burdens upon their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, tho' for the neceſſary Succours they want, after having charged them without Neceſſity: As there is no other Juſtice, than the Will of the Soveraign, which is as unconſtant as his Paſſions, there is no Obedience neither amongſt the Subjects, but as much as they can be brought to it by Force, which cannot be always equal.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the Greatneſs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire afforded them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs many Helps, and the Vizier was ſoon in a readineſs to ſend fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men into <hi>Hungary;</hi> whereof he ſent ſome part towards <hi>Adrianople</hi> in the Spring. The Imperialiſts on their ſide had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110070:155"/>begun, in the middle of the Winter, to block up <hi>Themiſwear,</hi> which they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to beſiege the next Campagne. <hi>Tec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely</hi> acquainted the <hi>Turks</hi> with it, and let them underſtand, that if they would ſend him ſome Succours, he would not only throw it into <hi>Themiſwear,</hi> but alſo ſeize upon one part of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> which was weary of the Imperialiſts, and who would be glad to lay hold on that Opportunity to declare themſelves againſt them.

                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> ſent ſome Succours to <hi>Tec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely,</hi> who endeavoured to lead them to <hi>Themiſwear;</hi> but having been wounded as he was forcing a Paſſage, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to go back towards <hi>Walaquia,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, which was meeting together at <hi>Sophia</hi> in <hi>Bulgaria,</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:110070:155"/>That cauſed the Imperialiſts to apply themſelves about fortifying <hi>Belgrade,</hi> as well as it could poſſibly, ſeeing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and the Charges occaſioned by the War the Emperour had upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> did put him in; becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> are very bad Inginiers, they thought indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Fortifications, or rather ſome Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the old ones would ſerve to defend the Place; which has been the cauſe it has been loſt ſince.

They betook themſelves too to block up <hi>Great Waradin,</hi> and they began by plundering and ſpoiling the Country round about the place, to hinder the Garriſon from having any means to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. They expected to attaque, by that means, three Places at once, the two Towns we have already ſpoken of, and that of <hi>Themiſwear,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Turks,</hi> being a great way off, could not carry Victuals thither, but with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, chiefly to <hi>Caniſa,</hi> which was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt of all; but they could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Convoys from getting at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times into <hi>Themiſwear</hi> and <hi>Waradin.</hi>

The Imperial Troops being ſo divided, thoſe that were about <hi>Waradin</hi> did not find themſelves ſtrong enough to keep the Garriſon within the Place; for after having repelled it back twice with great difficulty, they were wholly defeated at the third Sally, and their Commander made a Priſoner; five or ſix hundred of them remained dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spot, the reſt betook themſelves to their Heels. <hi>Teckely</hi> did the beſt he could, on his ſide, to raiſe the Blockade of <hi>Themiſwear,</hi> which felt already great Incommodities, for not having been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Victuals.

After the taking of that place, three thouſand <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laquians</hi> came to him, in ſpite of General <hi>Heuſter,</hi> who lay upon the Frontiers of <hi>Walaquia</hi> with a Body of Troops to oppoſe to the Deſigns of the Count. The <hi>Walaquians</hi> feared extreamly, leaſt the Imperialiſts ſhould enter into their Territories, as they had done into thoſe of the <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> and uſe them as they <hi>pleas'd;</hi> but they committed the <hi>ſame fault</hi> as the laſt had done, that is, that inſtead of acting openly for the <hi>Turks,</hi> and making all their Endeavours to ſupport that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Party, they did but help them under-hand; a Conduct that did but ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate the Emperour, but not hinder him from quartering his Troops amongſt them. The <hi>Moldavians</hi> did alſo the ſame, and found themſelves at laſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the ſame Troubles, altho' a little leſs by reaſon of their being afar off.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> was advanced, in <hi>July,</hi> as far as the River <hi>Morave,</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Army's March; having had notice, that that Army was ſtronger than his, which conſiſted not of full thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, that the <hi>Turks</hi> was fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, he returned the ſame way; and to increaſe his Army, he got the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110070:157"/>of many little Towns to be level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Ground, along the <hi>Danube,</hi> and took out of them the Troops that were in Garriſon therein. The <hi>Turks</hi> having ſeen the Chriſtian Army return towards <hi>Belgrade,</hi> paſſed the River <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rave</hi> to follow it; but having had notice they had received ſome Reinforcement from <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> went back again over the River, and retired themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Niſſa,</hi> where they intrenched themſelves. Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to follow them, but there fell ſuch a quaintity of Rain, that it was impoſſible to overcome the difficulty of the Ways; and the Proviſions having begun to grow ſcarce, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to return back towards the Bridges they had laid over the <hi>Morave,</hi> hard by <hi>Paſſarowis:</hi> The Army arrived there at the end of <hi>August,</hi> and was ſoon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who believed the Chriſtians did fly from them a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time: The Infidels made a great Detachment of their Cavalry, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome Janiſaries, to diſturb the March of the Chriſtian Army, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to intercept the Convoys, which would come from <hi>Semandria,</hi> where the Magazines of the Chriſtians were. But that Detachment was defeated the 29 of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110070:157"/>
                     <hi>August,</hi> and betook it ſelf to flight, after having loſt five or ſix hundred Men. The next day the Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my advanced to that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who expected them, being regularly drawn in Battalia beyond a Wood.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians had croſſed the Wood, and their Infantry was drawn up in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel-array in the Plain beyond it, under the favour of a Miſt, when the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clearing up, made the <hi>Turks</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Fault they had committed, in letting almoſt all the Enemy's Army to paſs without having made any Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Upon which they came forward to charge it with much Fury, but having been received with great Valour, they gave back; and the Chriſtian Army ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advanced accordingly, the Horſe had room enough to inlarge their Wings, and to aſſault the Infidels: Preſently they gave way every-where, and they had been cut into pieces, if the Ground had not been incumbered with Woods and Entrenchments, beyond which the <hi>Turks</hi> did rally, and which were to be forced one after another. Having been repelled thus, they retired into their Camp, where it was thought they would hold out; but they were ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, that as ſoon as they perceived
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:110070:158"/>ſome Imperial Regiments appear, they left it, with all their Cannon and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and alſo the beſt part of their Baggage. The Chriſtian Army went to encamp itſelf in it, and found therein almoſt a hundred Pieces of Cannon, and much Ammunitions for War, of which they were in great want. Thoſe of the <hi>Turks</hi> were commanded by a <hi>Seraſquier,</hi> a Title which ſignifies a General in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language, and which doth not belong to any Dignity of the Court; it was compoſed of ſome diſciplined Souldiers of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> but chiefly of new raiſed Troops, uncapable to ſtand againſt Veteran Souldiers, as were the Imperialiſts: however, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained not altogether ſo great Loſſes, becauſe their Troops did not perſiſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately to defend the Poſts committed to their Guard, but did flie before they were purſued too cloſe.</p>
                  <p>During the Chriſtians and the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſeeking one another for fighting, Count <hi>Teckely</hi> ſeized upon <hi>Otſowa</hi> upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> towards <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Imperialiſts, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could throw ſome Succours into <hi>Themiſwear:</hi> But having had order from the Vizier to march towards <hi>Niſſa,</hi> to reinforce the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, he gave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110070:158"/>that Deſign. He was not for all that in the Defeat, the Orders he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved coming too late, or not having made haſt enough. Whether it was through Prudence or Chance, he had not been yet in any great Army of the <hi>Turks,</hi> when they had been reſolved to fight: however, ſuch were his Circumſtances as render'd it his beſt Policy to avoid it, as every ways dangerous for him, becauſe being engaged to venture himſelf upon ſuch an occaſion, to encourage the <hi>Turks</hi> by his Example, and to get their Eſteem; it might have unluckily happened that he had been taken by the Imperialiſts, for want of not being conſtantly and ſufficiently ſuſtained and ſupported by the <hi>Turks.</hi> On the contrary, if he had mannaged himſelf, the <hi>Turk</hi> would have believed, that he did not rely upon them; therefore they had accuſed him of Cowardize or Treachery, according to the Succeſs of the Fight. Thus it was more ſafe for him to ſhun the Occaſions, where there was every way ſo great Danger.</p>
                  <p>The Imperial Army having tarried ſome days in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp, to reſt themſelves, they thought it convenient to ſend back one part of it, for fear leſt they ſhould want Victuals, and to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110070:159"/>march with the other towards <hi>Niſſa;</hi> in hopes to prevail there if poſſible, thro' the Conſternation the <hi>Turks</hi> were in, before they had time to recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> marched at the head of ſixteen thouſand Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Niſſa,</hi> as ſpeedily as he could: He came thither the 23d of <hi>September,</hi> and found the Enemy well entrenched before the Place. He diſpoſed the Army in order to fight, although the Enemy was ſtronger by half, but they never went out of their Lines. The next day the Imperial Army marched to look for ſome weak ſide, and to aſſault the Enemy that way: it went along their Camp, during ſome hours, without diſcovering any place whereby they could ſet upon them; but at laſt they found one ſide covered by a Hill, which was not entrenched, and it was reſolved to attack them that way. The <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Chriſtians, poſted upon the top of it a body of Janiſaries, and began to entrench themſelves. The Chriſtian Army commanded ſome Regiments to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, to remove the Janiſaries; and the <hi>Turks</hi> ſent ſome Spahees to attack the Chriſtians in the Flanck, during that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; but the Chriſtian Horſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently advanced to receive the Spahees,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110070:159"/>and repelled them eaſily enough. The Janiſaries made a greater Reſiſtance, but at laſt the Imperialiſts made them run, and carried ſome Cannon upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Ground, whence they began to play upon the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp; the Spahees came to the Charge again, and the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſtood firm a little way off; but the Spahees having been broken, betook themſelves to the flight in earneſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out minding of turning back; the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries fired once upon them to force them to turn back, which increaſed their Diſorder: So that the Seraſquier ſeeing there was no way for the rallying of his Troops, ſcared by the loſs of two Fights, thought it was high time to fly away: the Night, and Wearineſs of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, who had been in Arms ſince the Morning, made their Retreat the more eaſie, and hindered them from being purſued. The Chriſtian Army ſpent that night in the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp, where it had time and the means to refreſh itſelf with the Proviſions it found in it. The next day it entered <hi>Niſſa</hi> without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, the Town not being fortified. Three thouſand Horſe were preſently detached, to march towards <hi>Sophia,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Seraſquier was fled: They came again ſome days after, and upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110070:160"/>they brought concerning the <hi>Turks</hi> Conſternation, and the Goodneſs of the Country, it was reſolved to leave one part of the Army at <hi>Niſſa,</hi> to ſpend there the Winter, and fortifie in ſome manner that place. During the time the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> was at <hi>Niſſa,</hi> the Seraſquier ſent him <hi>Muſtapha Aga,</hi> to beſeech him to give a Paſs-port and a Convoy to go to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and joyn the other Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Port. The Prince granted him what he petitioned for, but that new Envoy had no new Propoſals to make: they acquainted him, it may be, with the Diverſion of <hi>France,</hi> leaſt they ſhould conclude any thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Teckely</hi> having heard of the Defeat of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army at <hi>Niſſa,</hi> while he was in his March, took his way towards <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtria;</hi> thence he went to <hi>Sophia,</hi> where the Grand Vizier was, and got thither the 19th of <hi>October,</hi> follow'd with a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a hundred Perſons, after having left the Troops he commanded, which were encamped ſome Miles off of the Town. The Vizier welcomed him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, and preſented him with a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Veſt, and ſome gallant Horſes: he certified him the Grand Seignior was extreamly well ſatisfied with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; exhorted him to continue to act
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110070:160"/>with Vigor againſt the common Enemy, and aſſured him of the Protection of the Port. The Count had many Diſcourſes with the Vizier, and the other <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officers, to conſider what might be done to ſtop the Imperialiſts Progreſs: While they were a conſulting together, they had notice that the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> had taken his March from <hi>Niſſa</hi> towards the <hi>Danube,</hi> where he made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Widden,</hi> a place of moment to paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Walaquia,</hi> where he had a mind to give his Troops Winter-quarters: he was arrived before that Place the 14th of <hi>October,</hi> had beaten two Baſſa's encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereabout, and reduced it to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der four days after, although he had but four Field-pieces, the great Cannon not being come from <hi>Semandria.</hi> The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, very ſorry for this News, ordered <hi>Teckely</hi> to go to <hi>Nicopoli,</hi> to prevent the Deſigns they might have upon that Place, and to endeavour to retake <hi>Widden,</hi> if it was poſſible.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time General <hi>Picolomini,</hi> who had tarried at <hi>Niſſa</hi> with ſome part of the Army, made ſome Incurſions in the neighbouring Countries: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Niſſa,</hi> he died of a Cholick at <hi>Priſtina,</hi> leaving the command of the Army to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> till the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110070:161"/>Emperour had named a new Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> beat again ſeveral times the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Servia;</hi> but the Advantages and Progreſs of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts carried every day, having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them too bold, their Carreer and Progreſs was chect by a conſiderable Loſs that befel them:</p>
                  <p>Not having had notice that a Body of ten thouſand <hi>Tartars,</hi> delivered at laſt of the fear they were in of the <hi>Poland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> who had reſolved to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the defenſive, had paſs'd the <hi>Danube,</hi> and joyned the <hi>Turks,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their March without fear, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſpeeded to find ſome Booty or Enemies. One day, that five Regiments were advancing with ſpeed to ſurpize a Body of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Troops, they found themſelves ſurrounded by the Infidels, four times ſtronger than they were, and were all cut off, very few ſcaping to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the news of that Defeat.</p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Hanover</hi> periſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many other Perſons of note, in ſpight of a vigorous Reſiſtance, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been willing to accept any Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>This engaged the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> to look about himſelf more carefully than before; and the General <hi>Veteranie,</hi> who
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110070:161"/>came to Command in the Room of <hi>Pico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini,</hi> retired all his Troops to <hi>Niſſa;</hi> leaſt in leaving them divided, the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> ſhould ſurprize them, as they had lately done the four or five Thouſand Men, whom they had cut in Pieces.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> after having left a Garriſon in <hi>Widden,</hi> to have always a free Paſſage over the <hi>Danube,</hi> paſſed that River to enter into <hi>Walaquia,</hi> and ſent to the Hoſpodar, he was a coming to leave there Six Regiments in Winter Quarters, to ſecure his Country againſt the <hi>Tartars.</hi> The Hoſpodar and the States fearing equally, offered the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts a conſiderable Sum of Money, to free themſelves from Lodging thoſe Troops, and repreſented alſo that, Six Regiments quartered amongſt them were capable indeed to draw upon themſelves the <hi>Tartars,</hi> but not to ſtand againſt thoſe Infidels. For that Reaſons ſake they intreated them to give them more; but at laſt they come again to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Six, and engaged themſelves to entertain them, and to remount thoſe of the Horſe-men, who had loſt their Horſes. The Prince charged thoſe Troops to Build ſome Forts in the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from whence they feared the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> ſhould come; and conveyed the reſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110070:162"/>of his Troops into <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> after he took his way to <hi>Vienna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Altho' the <hi>Tartars</hi> had not obtained a great advantage upon the Imperialiſts, and that in going on at that Rate, there was great hopes for the <hi>Turks</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what they had loſt; the Grand Vizier and the <hi>Caimacan</hi> were both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, and Strangled, as having ill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the Affairs of their Maſter. <hi>Cuperli Ogli, Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Chio,</hi> was made Grand Vizier, and another <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the ſame name got the <hi>Caimacan's</hi> place. After that they ſent a Courier to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to carry a Letter to the Emperor, and new Inſtructions to the Envoys that were there.</p>

                  <p>That Courier Arrived in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Year 1690, and preſented to the Emperor the Grand Seiginor's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which contained only ſome General Propoſitions concerning the Peace. It was thought the Envoys knew ſomething more, and becauſe they demanded eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know the Emperors Pretentions, that they might acquaint their Maſter with them, they received theſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Writing:

                     </list> Theſe Propoſals having appeared too Exceſſive to the Envoys, their Anſwer provoked the Imperial Councel to Anger. They propoſed only to quit to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror what remained in the <hi>

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:110070:163"/>
                  <p>They diſpoſed themſelves in the mean while at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to carry on the War, as Vigorouſly as they could, and amongſt ſeveral Opinions Startled up, two, they ſay, were the Chief: The firſt was to Continue in ſending a Great Body of Troops into <hi>Servia,</hi> to Act there againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and carry further the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts they had made, and to Fortifie. <hi>Niſſa.</hi> The other Advice was to leave thoſe new Conqueſts, and to Exauſt <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> wholly, to apply themſelves to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <hi>Belgrade,</hi> which was not done. All that wanted to be done, according to the Opinion of thoſe that propoſed this Second Advice, was to Reduce <hi>Giula, Themiſwear,</hi> and <hi>Great Waradin,</hi> to be quite Maſters of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves afterwards upon the Defenſive.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe, who were for the firſt Opinion, repreſented that it would be a ſhameful thing, and that it would expreſs a great weakneſs, to quit what had been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered: That that Conduct would not fail to raiſe the Enemies Courage, and to give them ſome new Hopes, That in the weakneſs and the fear they were in, there was only need to Repel them, and that that would quite put them in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; that ſo much the nearer they ſhould approach <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſo much
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110070:163"/>the more the Seditions ſhould be more Frequent, and by Conſequence the Grand Seignior ſhould be more uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to gather a Powerful Army: That the <hi>Moldavians,</hi> and <hi>Walaquians,</hi> would Declare themſelves for the <hi>Turks,</hi> as ſoon as they could perceive they were a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring: That the places, which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſhould fall of themſelves into the Emperor's Hands, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to Intercept the Proviſions, and that ſo much the Eaſier, by keeping the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army farther off of the Frontiers of <hi>Hungary:</hi> That an Indifferent Army could do what they wanted, by reaſon that the moſt part of the Old <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Troops were dead, and that henceforth the Army could be compos'd only of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers newly raiſed by Force. They ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened that Opinion with many other ſpecious Reaſons, and ſo much the more agreeable to them who had no Skill in Wars, that they ſeemed to agree with their deſires, as more honourable to the Imperial Arms.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide they aſſerted, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Forces were not ſo ſmall, nor ſo contemptible as they thought, becauſe, if they were helped by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> as it was probable they ſhould be, they ſhould be in a Caſe to Beat the Imperial
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110070:164"/>Armeis, whereof they were obliged to make too many Detachments, and to keep them too Remote one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that they could cut them off, if they did Fight them, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they not being able to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves reciprocally: That it was impoſſible to entertain an Army in <hi>Servia,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> had Ruined it, and would Ruine it ſtill more: That if they had the worſt in a Battel, as that might happen, the farther advanced they would be, the more difficult it would be to Retreat, which would put the whole Army to Flight; that they ſhould not conſider it as a ſmall matter to reduce all <hi>Hungary</hi> into the Emperor's Hands, and to keep it ſo, that they ſhould be no more in danger of looſing it; which they would be expoſed to, in undertaking too much: That that very thing would keep all the Neighbourhood in its Duty, without any need of hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any thing elſe. They added ſome other Diſcourſes of the ſame nature, which aimed all to ſtick to the ſureſt. But the firſt Opinion was eſteemed beſt, and they did not perceive, it was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with Reaſons more Specious than Solid, but after this Reſolution was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd, there was no more time to change for the better part.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:110070:164"/>

                  <p>In the ſame time <hi>Teckely</hi> did forget nothing to engage the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> to acknowledge him for <hi>Viavode,</hi> promiſing all ſort of Advantage to them, who would declare themſelves for him; and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110070:167"/>threatning to uſe as Rebels thoſe who would ſtand againſt him. Some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> acknowledged him, and ſent him Envoys; but the moſt part of the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> took the Party of <hi>Abaffi,</hi> and deſired the Succours from the Emperour. The Marqueſs <hi>Doria,</hi> who had been made a Priſoner by the <hi>Tartars</hi> and redeemed by <hi>Teckely,</hi> went to <hi>Vienna</hi> upon the General <hi>Heuſler</hi>'s word, to get ſome Money for his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: He carried a Letter to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Ragotski</hi> from her Husband, to whom he brought ſoon after an Anſwer, wherein ſhe expreſſed to have a great mind to be exchanged for General <hi>Heu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſler</hi> a Priſoner.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Vizier marching towards <hi>Belgrade,</hi> attacked ſo ſuddenly the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lank of <hi>Semandria,</hi> that the Garriſon, which had order to quit it, and ruine the place, had not the time to do it: Having taken the Reſolution to defend itſelf, and not having taken well its Meaſures, it was forced the fourth day, and put to the Sword. The <hi>Turks</hi> found in it ſome Pieces of Cannon, and a few Ammunitions, becauſe they had carried into <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and elſewhere, what they had before in it. The very ſecond of <hi>Octob.</hi> he laid the Siege to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110070:168"/>he aſſaulted very briskly; and which the General <hi>Aſpremont,</hi> who had thrown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into it, defended as well as he could. The Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> entred into it a little while after with ſeven or eight hundred Men. But becauſe the old Breaches were but palliſadoed, and the place ill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Pioneers, and Tools to work the Ground; there was no likelihood to hold out long, although they had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of other neceſſary Proviſions. And yet one would never have thought the <hi>Turks</hi> had been able to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of it, after ſix days ſiege; but an Accident that happened, was the cauſe that that place fell the eighth of <hi>October</hi> into their hands, a Bomb having fallen upon a Tower where the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of the Powder was, which ſhould have been in Cellars, overthrew not only that Tower with horrible. Noiſe and Damage, but deſtroyed many neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Houſes, and ſet ſome others on fire. The <hi>Turks</hi> laying hold on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order which that occaſioned, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the Paliſadoes with ſuch a Fury, that they took the place, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made yet in it any Breach, and put to the Sword all that they met; and forced the Commander to run away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Danube,</hi> upon ſome Saiques, with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110070:168"/>ſeven or eight Hundred Men. They retired to <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> to make their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to keep that Poſt, which they had not Fortifyed yet; by reaſon they thought the <hi>Turk</hi> would never come ſo far. Therefore it wanted but a little, but they had loſt it ſome while after. The Vizier having cauſed ſome of his Troops to paſs the <hi>Save,</hi> ſent them that way, to attack that Place, which they expected to carry eaſily. But having not done it with the Vigor that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, they had Advice, that a great many Imperal Forces were a coming to Succour it; and they ſay, they thought them already come, hearing the ſound of the Trumpets and Kettle-drums, which by way of Amuſement had been ſent out of that place the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with an order to return with a great Noiſe through the <hi>Moraſs</hi> Way. Upon that falſe Suſpicion they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the 6th of <hi>November</hi> with ſo great a Precipitation, that they left their Cannon, and one part of their Bagage, to reach the ſooner to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> whither they ſpeeded away.</p>
                  <p>There was a report then that they had offered to make Peace with <hi>Teckely,</hi> and that they were willing to know from him, what it was he expected from the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110070:169"/>Emperor. Some Articles too, have been publiſhed, wherein he asks not only the Principality of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> but alſo the reſtoring of all his States, and the Reſtauration of the Priviledges of <hi>Hungary,</hi> many places in that Kingdome, to be made a Prince of the Empire, and other things, that ſeems to be ſo unlikely, that we will ſay no more of it. The Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> having received all the ſuccours he expected, advanced with an Army ſtronger than that of <hi>Teckely,</hi> both for the Number and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Troops, to offer him Battle; but <hi>Teckely</hi> knew how to avoid it, and choſe rather to Retire upon the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Moleavia,</hi> than to hazard any thing. If the Vizier had had any great skill in Warlike Affairs, he ſhould have preſently after the taking of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> followed the Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> or march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in order to joyn with <hi>Teckely,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf Maſter with him of <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania.</hi> But the <hi>Turks</hi> can, no more than ſome other Nations, make ſo good uſe of their advantages, as to boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their Victories. All that they did, was to take <hi>Lippa,</hi> and to throw ſome Proviſions and Troops in <hi>Giula, Themiſwear,</hi> and <hi>Waradin.</hi> Thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons being increaſed made ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads

                  <p>All the remedy they found againſt it, was to gather as many Troops as they could, and to follow the <hi>Turks</hi> in their retreat; which they did happily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, ſeeing they killed many of thoſe who were the ſloweſt, and that they delivered a conſiderable number of Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>During the time the <hi>Turks</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Hungary, Teckely</hi> entred into it too through <hi>Walaquia.</hi> They ſent to meet himtthe Prince of <hi>Auguſte of Hanover,</hi> Serjeant General of Battle at the Head of a Thouſand Horſes. That Prince having attacked Fifteen Hundred Men, who were intrenched in a paſſage Raſhly, was wholly defeated, and himſelf kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the Spot. And yet <hi>Teckely</hi> made no uſe of that Defeat, by reaſon of the hardneſs of the Seaſon, which hindered him from engaging himſelf further into <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> having heard beſides the <hi>Turks</hi> were retired. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110070:170"/>into <hi>Walaquia,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> took his way towards <hi>Vienna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Young <hi>Abaffi</hi> and his Friends, ſupported by the Imperial Troops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan then to ſearch out thoſe that had declared themſelves for <hi>Teckely.</hi> They uſed them no leſs roughly than they had done the Rebls in <hi>Hungary,</hi> as if the Emperor had had more right to raiſe <hi>Abaffi</hi> to the dignity of <hi>Vaivadoe,</hi> than the Grand Seignor had to inveſt <hi>Teckely</hi> with it. But it is no new thing, that the party which has the better, has the Juſtice and Reaſon on his ſide. The States of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> followed the choyce of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and gave their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that <hi>Abaffi</hi> ſhould be their Prince, under the Emperor's protection. Not being come yet to age fit to govern by himſelf: they named a Chancellor, and a Council, compoſed of <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> who took upon themſelves the charge of the Affairs. They promiſed alſo to the Emperor's Commiſſioners, to give their Maſter two Hundred Thouſand Livers <hi>per annum</hi> in Silver, and ſo much in Corn, while the War ſhould laſt, a Tribute much larger than that the <hi>Vaivodes</hi> of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> had uſed to pay before to the Port.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:110070:172"/>the mean time, as there was no other way to ſave the Imperial Army, than by expoſing it to theſe Risks, it march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the next Day, being the 19 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> towards the Trenches of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which were found to be much better, than had been Imagined. About three in the Afternoon, the Right Wing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked thoſe, who regarded the Camp of the Imperialiſts, and the Left Wing was to make a greater compaſs, in order to ſet upon that place, which lookt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The Right Wing was received by the <hi>Janizaries</hi> with ſo much reſolution, that they repulſed it a great way from its Lines, and with much loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. But the Left Wing having found the ſoil more commodious, broke through the Lines of the <hi>Turks,</hi> whilſt their Horſe, who were gone out to oppoſe its March, Skirmiſhed againſt ſome Squadrons of the Chriſtian Army. <hi>Teckely.</hi> who was at the Head of the Horſe, ſeeing the Camp forced on one ſide, and diſorder in the Troops, prepared himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. The Right Wing of the Chriſtian Army, having followed the left, and abandoned its attack, where it found too much reſiſtance, gave opportunity to the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and what remained of Horſe in the Camp, to get off on this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110070:173"/>ſide: The approaching Night, (this Action having laſted near three Hours, the wearineſs of the Imperialiſts, their loſſes, and their deſire of Plunder,) gave the <hi>Turks</hi> an occaſion to retire, altho' the Grand Vizier had been killed.</p>
                  <p>The Imperialiſts, as it is ſaid, left in this Fight above 6000 Men upon the place, and had double as many wounded, of which ſeveral died in the end. A great number of Officers remain'd there, and the Army inſtead of purſuing the <hi>Turks,</hi> took the road of <hi>Peter-Waradin;</hi> as the <hi>Turks</hi> retired towards <hi>Belgrade,</hi> after having loſt 18000 Men of their ſide. This victory of the Imperialiſts, being none of thoſe which they deſired to obtain often, put them out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to undertake any thing, on this ſide of the <hi>Danube;</hi> and they thought only upon repoſing themſelves, and re-enforcing their Army by detachments out of the neighbouring Garriſons, for fear the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould make any attempt.</p>
                  <p>The 28th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> a party of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> came to take away ſome Cattel, and ſome Horſes from the Imperial Army, and altho' orders had been given for a ſpeedy purſuance of them, they could overtake but ſome few, who were made. Priſoners. It was known to them, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110070:173"/>the Turkiſh Army was encamped near <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and that thoſe <hi>Baſſa's,</hi> who had ſaved themſelves, kept it in good order, notwithſtanding the Vizier, and the Aga of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Chriſtian Army having remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Peter-Waradin,</hi> till ſuch time as it was in a condition not to be taken of a ſudden, left a Garriſon in it, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it ſelf in two Bodys, whereof one commanded by the Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> took the way of <hi>Eſſeck;</hi> and the other, which was conducted by the Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> paſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>September,</hi> and marched towards <hi>Zolnock,</hi> along the River <hi>Teys.</hi> During this March, <hi>Lippa</hi> was retaken by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Veterani,</hi> who was ordered to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it. From <hi>Zolnock</hi> the Army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>Great-Waradin,</hi> which the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> view'd the 10th of <hi>October.</hi> After which the place was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly beſieged, and bombarded, to try if it might be won by that means: The <hi>Turks</hi> defended themſelves with much Reſolution; after having diſputed the Ground with the Imperialiſts as well as they could, they retired the twenty third into an Intrenchment pallizado'd,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110070:174"/>which they had made round the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. The Imperialiſts continu'd to puſh them even into the Cittadel where they made a pretty conſiderable Breach, but the Ditch being full of Water, without any poſſibility of draining it, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at length to reſolve upon turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Siege into a Blockade, upon the ſeventh of <hi>November.</hi> Thus the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Army was obliged to abandon an Enterprize, which it had undertaken, as it ſeems, only to let the <hi>Turks</hi> ſee, that the Victory had not been ſo bloody as they imagined, ſince it durſt afterwards beſiege one of their ſtrongeſt Places: if ſo be they did not ſucceed to their Wiſhes, at leaſt the <hi>Turks</hi> might ſee by it, that the Imperialiſts did not want Courage. The death of the Grand Vizier <hi>Cuperli,</hi> who was ſucceeded by <hi>Hali Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> prevented them from ſhewing the Imperialiſts in their turn, that the loſs of a Battel had not exhauſted their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They were alſo worſted in <hi>Sclavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> where they abandoned <hi>Gradiska,</hi> and let ſeveral ſmall places be taken by the Duke of <hi>Croy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who commanded that body of the Army which acted on this ſide. Beſides, the blockade of <hi>Waradin</hi> was not unuſeful, ſince by that means the Place was reduced to Capitulate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110070:174"/>on the 3d of <hi>June,</hi> in the following year 1692, after a Months Seige, as ſhall be more at large recited in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this Hiſtory, when there ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive ſufficient matter to make an Adition.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> put his Troops in Winter-quarters, after having left a competent number to continue the blockade of <hi>Waradin,</hi> which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the Prince of <hi>Averſperg.</hi> If the rigour of the ſeaſon had permitted them to preſs the Attacks, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Baſſa of this City to hold out long; ſince ſeveral Perſons, who found means to get out, reported that the Garriſon, which had conſiſted of above 3000 Men, at the beginning of the Siege, was reduced to leſs than half; that moſt part of the Proviſions were either burnt, or conſumed; and that the Garriſon, was obliged to live in Caves co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Earth and Ruins, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there with the utmoſt inconvenience.</p>
                  <p>During the Siege of <hi>Waradin,</hi> a Turk, who paſſed out of this place through the Camp of the Imperialiſts, without being known, reported at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> whither he went, That he had heard a <hi>Radzian</hi> ſay, That the Counts <hi>Teckely</hi> and <hi>Petrozzi</hi> had wrote to Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> That had it not been for them,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110070:175"/>the Seraſquier had gone to relieve <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin,</hi> and that the Emperour owed to them this Obligation; That if he would Negotiate with them for their Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, General <hi>Heuſler</hi> could inſtruct him of their pretenſions. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this information was falſe, the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> fell upon them, as upon Traytors, and the Seraſquier had much ado to ſecure them from the Fury of the Souldiers, who intirely plundered their Baggages. It was eaſie for the Counts to ſhew the falſehood of this Accuſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince the Seraſquier knew, that he had been of opinion himſelf to attempt the Relief of <hi>Waradin.</hi> They had alſo a mind to render <hi>Teckely</hi> ſuſpected, becauſe he had releaſed General <hi>Heuſler,</hi> upon condition that his Wife ſhould be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him; but that having been done by the conſent of the deceas'd Vizier, and the chief Officers of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Seraſquier made no ſcruple in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. In the mean time the noiſe of the apprehenſion of the Count, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed, was a ſubject of much joy to the Imperialiſts, who believed him loſt, and much affliction to the <hi>Hungarians</hi> that followed him, who were at <hi>Wipalanka,</hi> upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> which they paſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, for fear of being cut in pieces
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:110070:175"/>by the Infidels. But the two Counts, being freed, ſoon went to ſeek them, and brought them back into <hi>Servia,</hi> where they took their Quarters about <hi>Poſſarowits.</hi> Thus <hi>Teckely</hi> eſcaped once more the brutallity of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Troops, amongſt which he will hardly ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in perfect ſafety. He has had this good Fortune, in his Diſgraces, to live to the year 1692 amongſt theſe barbarous People, reſpected of the Generals, and beloved of the Port, whilſt it has rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a very great number of its beſt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, under pretence of their ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, by reaſon of the loſſes which it had received by the War. Happy, if the ſame reaſon doth not cauſe his deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one day; or if he can ſee a Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between the two Empires, and live in ſome corner of the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fearing the Reſentments of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria!</hi> We will end here, till pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time gives us more Information.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Year</hi> 1692 <hi>was Spent without any Action between the two Armies, they being both ſo weak, that neither of them durſt attempt to force the other, tho they lay the moſt part of the Summer near each other, on the</hi> Danube <hi>in</hi> Sclavonia.</p>
